Much talk from this forum, one of 1908 posts, including intellectual talks about - theoretical alien speicies, how a hypothetical sentient species evolves on various worlds and resulting characterisitcs, astronomy, serious-minded UFOs and exosolar life that has intelligent and educated non-conspiracy-theory scientific discussions as well as silly and shortsighted ignorant ultra-religious 'quick-and-snappy' paranoid rejection of alien life combined with tin foil hat psychotic talk and other discussions inbetween such, hard sci-fi and soft-sci-fi, intelligent talk as well as Chris-Sandusky-style-logic and what a 'wordoid' is, what a 'freshy' is [slang term, used in Antarctic historical species colonies where such live and such populations also go to [public] school and have local banks and convenience stores] etc, possible references to why some Antarctic human towns that have scientists seem to have an intelligent and clear-headed and non-infected understanding of global climate change and how dangerous funny-looking colored clouds in the sky are yet also 'mail-order' very large supplies of condoms for the six-month winters [believe it or not, there IS a casual, logical relationship between these two concepts, amid crackpot humor], and other stuff... -:

Idea #1500:
     2020-01-15    Common-Era   16:21  EST :  Speaking of Idea #1494 and #1499, I want the non-Nickelodeon version.  Yes please!  [It sounds cheesy, but that's how it's said.  The same request with 'next' is if you want to change the subject, for ANY reason.  It isn't always granted, but its understood.]

Idea #1501:
     2020-01-15    Common-Era   16:21  EST :  I want to figure out what color[s] blood various 'sky boys' have, for what body parts and stuff.

Idea #1502:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   03:38  EST :  Regarding 'Brian' from Akron Children's Hospital, he was a victim of child abuse, and I was supposed to get to know him to learn about child abuse.  That's how he ended up in that psych ward.  If I had gotten to know him then things would have been a lot different from that point on, for me and him.  Because I didn't get to know him, not even his name, Sally Lynn Reeves then had the job of teaching me about child abuse in human culture another way, by doing it to me and not faking it and making me a victim of it.  I don't know what type of abuse he suffered from, and being told what type wasn't established and I also didn't ask.  Also whatever type it was he could have also been a good friend for sexual stuff that no humans do, and kicked off the recruitment program back then with myself getting my own body parts I should have for a tiger dragon zarakite.  He'll still look good with purple and gold hair, which means 'sky boy purple' and 'sky boy yellow' of course.

Idea #1503:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   05:05  EST :  Five types of penises are what 'sky boys' can have, and are - 'sky boy' penis, 'fleshy sky boy' penis, 'fleshy sky boy' penis with vestigal testicles, 'human' penis with working testicles, 'human' penis with no testicles -, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1504:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   05:05  EST :  No one from planet Earth knows even half of psychiatry of the Dark Hearted Queen's type.  No one from planet Earth could ever understand even half of psychiatry of the Dark Hearted Queen's type.  As such, anyone from Earth therefore lacks credibility when discussing anything involving Dark Hearted Queen psychiatry, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1505:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   05:05  EST :  No one from planet Earth knows even half of diabetes of the Dark Hearted Queen's type.  No one from planet Earth could ever understand even half of diabetes of the Dark Hearted Queen's type.  As such, anyone from Earth therefore lacks credibility when discussing anything involving Dark Hearted Queen diabetes, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1506:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:00  EST :  TigerStone boys are very impulsive.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1507:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:00  EST :  All zarakites are at least somewhat impulsive.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1508:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:00  EST :  When the skin color of some 'sky boy' is changed, all body parts that belong to him change to match.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1509:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:00  EST :  When the skin color of some 'sky boy' is changed, all body parts that belong to him change to match.  It doesn't matter what parts are connected or otherwise.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1510:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:00  EST :  There are three versions of body parts that any arbitrary body part can be, for a sky boy as well as a human.  This is irregardless of detachables and what is and is not attached.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1511:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:20  EST :  This is a news flash, the solar wyverns have at least two groups now, one that is called 'sun dragons' who are helpful allies, and the other are stoic and impartial in many ways to replace the exosolar 'Japan' that fell and didn't do anywhere enough of what they should have done to survive.  This is the same exosolar 'Japan' that managed Salt and other ingredients and insisted on keeping it steady and unable to make itself improve or get more powerful.  This exosolar 'Japan' also includes many who have become infected and happily disempower salt, and throttle back me going through brain cell changes to become a TigerStone, and also throttle back turning down suppression and let it get turned back on, and in all of these cases they do so with big cheerful smiles on their faces so to speak, and any good they do is brief and far too short to prove anything to anyone that could be used later, and as I see it is also both deceptive and uncooperative.  The one solar wyvern group had to replace them, and there was no other way, and they already just did this just now and already have it going [fully implemented] and won't [and can't] cancel or stop at this point.  They apparently had enough justification.

Idea #1512:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   21:04  EST :  All of the files at ' https://sourceforge.net/projects/scorchcrafter/files/Sky%20boy%20stuff/videos/2020-01-10/ ', as well as all of the video uploads at YouTube at ' https://www.youtube.com/user/Destructavator/videos ', including the recent ones like ' https://youtu.be/Etevi9G6dvs ' which I'm still uploading [there are 30 of them and they total 64 gigs altogether, in their original format], and more 'avi' video files that I'll have to upload to sourceforge at one or more of my projects.  These videos have content and audio and video that say a lot, about a lot of stuff, and many important discussions, and not just one or two of the many things that are in the many Ideas in the Idea list and other stuff, and even more with one side of some discussions that answer and say a lot when lined up with and in sync with other conversations, a lot of it really important stuff that many already have been keeping up with and remember over time, and need and can't ignore or refuse to 'compete' with, and they keep their own notes and records and need this stuff, and this isn't stuff that just anyone would or can do, which has come up in many of aforementioned, 'nuffs said.  It's interesting what does and doesn't survive mundane and non-mundane things that block remembering these things, as well as what they refer to of course, naturally.  [I was told to use that word and that words like that would be 'cleaned up', and for the good of many.]
	There's also all of the stuff at FaceBook, for the profile 'David Reeves' which also has ' Tiger's Eye Jade SwiftWing ' in parenthesis and a digital render of a TigerStone faced zarakite cheap rendering [with mistakes and errors, although the face has the fewest and other parts have the wrong proportions, and I know the ears of the model in the digital render are messed up, and we've already had discussions about how and what parts and what is and isn't going to be accepted as well as desired by the zarakite sex drive without playing dumb, which have the correct answers that will work and be accepted by recruiters and a working as well as real program, that would actually work and not sound like a joke, of course].  All of the things on that FaceBook profile and the uploads and posts and information, and what all of it refers to, are also included in this Idea and also part of a lot of the talks and discussions and stuff, and also important and 'essential' as Mr Standish says he wants it explained.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1513:
     2020-01-17    Common-Era   01:24  EST :  The zarakite sex drive isn't something that can, should, or ought to be characteristic of a machine or contraption that isn't a natural part of any sky boy or sky girl of ANY type or sort, that could ever be detached or seperated from one's self, or spirit or soul.  Never ever, not even for some extreme situation or emergency, no matter what justification for any improbable thing which is actually more-than-improbable in a literal way.  Failure to do so causes problems that empower and bring about bad space amoebas like Sally Lynn Reeves's posessor, evil dark hearted and dark trio cents that won't die or go away, and even a boring human who fakes being a 'Sallyism' and daytime nursing supervisor's arguements about women having sex and not having pleasure and being detached in so many ways and other mundane non-transcendant traditional human female stuff that they understand easily and don't have to be experts or professionals of any sorts to understand or argue.  Race or skin color makes no difference, or lifestyle really.  Especially when any sort of women like that is old enough, although I'm being told that it applies to all ages and I find that easily believable.  This is why the human female sex drive is so infected permanantly and won't ever go back, and must be replaced, I'm being told is the actual real answer, in real life and in real, and this whole Idea might be correct but either way I'm not going to put scripture to it and let others find out the answer and not mess it up and after all I'm not a female anyways and never will be and never can or ought to be one ever in any life or lifetime or future and as such wouldn't know and can't ever answer this alone but I find it easy to believe as well as imagine.

Idea #1514:
     2020-01-17    Common-Era   01:55  EST :  According to zarakite values an innocent immortal should not be bullied, abused, or allowed to suffer in such ways, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1515:
     2020-01-17    Common-Era   02:00  EST :  Telepathic discussions involving myself and human beings and life of planet Earth, from now [2:00 AM Eastern Standard Time, year 2020 Common Era] through last year, and other likewise discussions.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1516:
     2020-01-17    Common-Era   02:00  EST :  Sky children can be nervous and edgy and anxious when taken out of their comfort zone.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1517:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   13:41  EST :  Dark Hearted values support a 'no snitching' also-known-as 'no tattling' and 'no telling' thing as part of dark hearted values.  Dark hearted values as such support corruption and deliberately 'turning a blind eye' so to speak toward rule-breaking and illicit behavior, as well as 'looking the other way' when illicit behavior that involves breaking rules is noticed.  Zarakite values, by comparison, support one reporting to authority what was witnessed when people are bad, including when one isn't personally involved.  This type of thing has limits though, and is definite and for sure when law-breaking behavior is witnessed, especially that which involves theft and stealing, and even worse when someone's life and safety are at risk.  Zarakite values support a friendly neighborhood where a next-door neighbor accross a street will call someone on a phone to report what looks like a broken-down front door, if they don't know how it broke and just noticed it, and don't know anything about it.  With classrooms at high school zarakite values still have the same default although students will sometimes misbehave and not report it if they see another student misbehave, and this is normal, and still living life overall in zarakite values.  Being a 'teacher's pet' is socially inept which is very bad, and hurts one's reputation and personality which is really bad.  Overall, if in doubt as to where the line is drawn, if it is illicit but not illegal then it varies, but if it is outright against the law then zarakite values require calling police or authority of some sort although who qualifies as 'authority' varies before turning to local law enforcement such as a police department.  If staying at a hotel then the manager or some secretary or worker for hotel management will suffice.  Once the hotel management is going to get word of something illegal that may have happened, its then up to hotel management to involve police and-or lawyers and-or someone else and-or themselves as necessary, and it it their [hotel management's] job and responsibility to do that and no longer any responsibility or fault of anyone staying at the hotel.  Also, once someone staying at the hotel tells a worker at the hotel, if the worker says they will pass it on then the person staying there has done their part and is no longer responible for reporting anything any further.  If the person staying at the hotel isn't personally involved or affected by what he or she reported then the aforementioned person staying at the hotel doesn't typically have to worry about or even remember what they reported.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1518:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   15:20  EST :  Regarding Idea #1517, having zarakite values in place that include what was described in that Idea is a good thing in that it encourages everyday people and citizens to be good instead of law-breaking, and also reduces the need for security cameras in various public and commercial areas and more in towns and cities.  This is logical.  It is also compassionate as opposed to cold and psychopathic.  Compassionate people who care are better, and care about their own, and don't like to see crime occur in their cities and towns.  By comparison cold psychopathic types won't report anything and are actually suicidal in refusing to care to call and report anything they see, because criminals tend not to get caught but instead get away with what they start, and people who won't report crime may in fact be the next victim.  Also, criminals are going to tend to strike again where they think they can get away with it, which includes neighborhoods where they won't call the local police.  For citizens who don't care and won't call the police, I and zarakite values have no sympathy for victims of crime who would never call anyone.  Natural selection is at hand, one should let it happen and allow citizens who care to move in and take their place, which also makes a neighborhood where criminals won't get away with as much and won't try it in the first place, which makes nicer and safer neighborhoods with people that care, which is all-around a GOOD overall thing.  Logic and zarakite values agree, and so does SkyCrowne.  The zarakite sex drive does as well, and does NOT see mug shots of arrested people as 'sexy' in itself, at all, never ever.  Some females find that type of thing sexy, but the zarakite sex drive doesn't.  Then again, the zarakite sex drive isn't female.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1519:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   15:49  EST :  Regarding supercities, the main structure has 4 (four) corner towers and a single center tower, the NE tower, NW tower, SE tower, and SW tower, plus the center tower.  Bridges and other sub-structures that include junctions and have commercial and residential areas are built to be level and even with each other as well as perpendicular to what is completely horizontal according to the surface of the planet and the zenith and horizon in all directions.  Quad center structures, quad edge structures, and quad border structures are all capable of housing various residential and commercial and industrial zones with names and titles that include 'city' or 'town' or 'village' in part of the name in some cases.  What is handwritten by myself in pencil about these archology structures, as well as discussed in a number of conversations, and other related information, applies.  Logic and how things work in real life as what I'm used to, as I handwrote, is also included as well.  So are my flawed hand-drawn diagrams, which were not to scale and had many inaccuracies, but also were the best I could reasonably draw them under the conditions they were hand-drawn in, and were also what should have been expected considering aforementioned conditions.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1520:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   15:49  EST :  All things I wrote and drew and discussed, while at Clearvista, from Friday January 17th 2020 to Friday Februrary 7th 2020, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1521:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  'Draco' is now a term that refers to races of people that include kahjeet and griffons etc which have some dragon [zarakite dragon in this case] nature in them.  This dragon nature is biological and also magical in innate and natural ways, life-long in being permanent.  They [people who are of a draco race] are also called 'half dragon' and are also said to have a 'half dragon race'.  'Race' in this case affects skin colors and hair colors, natural and temporary.  A subdivision can be called a 'clan'.  The term 'bloodline' is another term for 'race'.  The terms 'draco' and 'half dragon' are adjectives.  A 'family' can be a subdivision of a clan, and typically is.  These terms, 'family' and 'clan', also apply to zarakites, who are their own race.

Idea #1522:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  There will be 10 (ten) total skin colors that all zarakites and all sky children and all draco race people can potentially have.

Idea #1523:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  There will be 10 (ten) total hair colors that all zarakites and all sky children and all draco race people can potentially have.

Idea #1524:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  A 'zero' is a name for an organic robot that isn't really a person, who talks and behaves like a computer.  Some also can fake acting like a person with an AI.  They simply have organic brain tissues instead of microchips, and their brain tissues are all pre-developed end-to-end and incapable of learning or self-improving or maturing.  They do however have memories and can remember things and as such fake having a personality something like a person of some sort.  They sometimes act to preserve themselves but not always.  In any case they always value a person's life above their own as a 'well duh' type of obvious thing and would actually say that out loud in a sentence in some cases if practical [if for example there is time to talk and it wouldn't put someone's life at risk of course].  They actually have what is similar to Asimov's three laws of robotics and use their organic eyes and ears and organic pre-developed intellects and intelligence to judge and guess and make decisions.  They do make honest mistakes and can tolerate and accept that without freaking out, unlike Asimov's robots from his science fiction stories.  Also, a zero's self-preservation is relaxed by comparison and actually very weak, and at times is completely ignored.  Isaac Asimov, an archaic Russian-born science fiction author, came up with three laws of robotics for his robots for his science fiction stories, and is the author of the original 'I Robot' and 'The Caves of Steel' and their sequels.  He came up with three laws that all robots with any AI (Artificial Intelligence) in his stories should have and always be incapable of breaking no matter what.  The first law was that a robot can never harm a human being, especially dealing death, and this was the most important law that always had precedence.  Zeros have this for all people [a zero himself is not a 'person'] although 'harm' is life-threatening in most cases as zeros can test playgrounds and in cases inflict superficial injuries casually although they still follow other rules and generally are well behaved yet also are used for hunting and swordfighting and warrior practice and as such need to inflict pain and hurt at times.  They also don't consider killing a body part or detachable, including a person's head, or all of them in a zarakite's case, to be 'life-threatening' or more than 'superficial' as they are aware of how zarakites respawn all the time and grow new body parts and themselves casually and often at times.  Zeros can also be programmed to joke and prank and involve killing a zarakite even as part of a joke or artificial personality [for example, while telling a zarakite to 'shut up' and the zarakite is respawned a second or two later, in the middle of a casual conversation], and this doesn't violate their rules or how their organic brains are programmed.  Zeros are of course not the same about humans and are very careful instead with humans, just like everyone else.  Asimov had a second rule, for a robot to always protect itself and not self-destruct.  Zeros kinda have this, typically when they still have a job to do that they were created for, and once their work is complete they don't mind being around for sex or jokes or simply talk, but are casual and okay with suicide and being killed and becoming worms, and of course this doesn't faze or upset them.  If they are told to wait around for hours after they think their work is complete, they might be like 'uh, okay, but I'll eventually have to eat something, and I don't know what I'm doing hanging around and not being in a worm bin, but, okay.....' and might point out that they are consuming food that others could eat and also costs money if they don't see why they should stick around.  Even if there is plenty of food, someone has to buy it or pay for it, and they have this logic and sense of what is obvious, among other things.  Asimov had a third law about how a robot always follows orders or instructions.  Zeros have their version of this, and so if they don't behave then their creator and-or their boss who gives them instructions is blamed, not the zero.  The zarakite value of 'bad student, bad teacher' works here.  Zeros can be created for battle practice and to make pretend criminals and pretend targets for training and hunting and cannon fodder and swordfighting and gunfighting and fist-fighting with spiked gloves etc.  They have rules and limits with their instructions though, for example if someone blows a whistle or something specific happens they use their own common sense which is organic and like that of a person to suddenly change how they act and talk.  Zeros have their own detachables, all of the same regions and body part types that people with detachables have.  No person can be or will be reincarnated as a zero.  Only a mouse can be reincarnated as a zero.  No zero is to be reincarnated as a person.  They have to be reincarnated as a non-sentient first.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1525:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  According to zarakite values, there is no such thing as a bad student, only a bad teacher in any classroom, and a teacher also decides if someone is accepted as their student or not.  This is considered when a student misbehaves outside the scope of the teacher's classroom and blame is sought, as well as who will repair or pay for any damage done [which is required to be offered and made to happen according to zarakite values, although the victim can forgive which is the victim's choice and the victim can't be bullied or forced or made to forgive of course].  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1526:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  There will be two skin colors out of the ten that are for zeros, a dark grey and a light grey.  Both are shades of grey that have no color.  The dark grey is not a perfect match for any skin color that any person has, except maybe an archaic as the closest thing.  The two colors can be called 'mechanical black' and 'mechanical white' even though neither are perfect black or white colors.

Idea #1527 isn't described or defined in this text.

Idea #1528:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  Skin colors range from 1 (one) to 10 (ten) although skin colors 9 and 10 are the two colors for zeros.  Skin color 1 is arctic white and is literally as white as fresh clean snowflakes that are still falling in daytime and bright sunlight and are made from clean water that lacks pollution.  Human beings don't ever have skin that bright a white, not even albinos.  Then again we aren't looking at skin colors for humans, except for sky children who are still considered very human.  Skin color 9 is a 'white' that some zeros have, while skin color 10 is a 'black' that other zeros have.  Skin color 8 is pitch black, literally, and just as dark as black clothing that hasn't faded, from laundry or anything else.  No archaic skin color naturally gets that black, not even in Africa with a lot of sunlight and being outdoors.  Skin colors 2 through 7 look like archaic human skin colors of various sorts, with lower numbers being more pale and more Caucasian White, and higher numbers getting darker and eventually becoming Negro and East-Indian-like, with 2 being the most pale Caucasian white that an archaic without any suntan can be, and 7 being a Negro with quite a suntan but still able to put on a pair of polyester black athletic shorts and not look quite the same as his shorts.

Idea #1529:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  Traditional humans are unable to impregnate, unable to get pregnant, and unable to have their own children.  They are dependant upon sky dragons and tiger dragons to give birth to newborn traditional humans for their families, which they do upon request, often as something quick and without hanging around and without getting to know the family first or afterwards.  Such zarakites give birth to such newborn traditional humans by ejaculating and forming the newborn out of the end of the tip of their dragon penis, much like how they respawn each other and ejaculate themselves accross a room and underneath a door and furniture, and give birth to anyone and anything, penile ejaculation.  No womb or vagina or internal fetus is ever involved, at all, ever.  No female lactation is involved either, ever.  Also, as a side note, zarakites lactace at times that is penile lactation that has nothing to do with when or how often they give birth to or respawn anyone or anything.  Their lactation is independent of such.  Note that sky dragons give birth to both genders of traditional humans with a variety of skin colors and ethnicities that humans are used to that they choose from their wristwatches before tapping their navels to start the process.  Tiger dragons give birth to male children only which are like other traditional humans but have a face from the list of one hundred faces out of the Book Of Faces, and tend to develop related personalities, but have human skin tones.  Note that human skin tones are 'floating point' and not 'integer' to describe them in an odd way used in the past that I personally don't actually like.  Human skin tones have blends and in-between colors, which is normal, unlike sky child and half-dragon and zarakite dragon skin colors which have no in-between variation from one person to the next, where two such people standing next to each other both with skin color 1 which is arctic white have exactly the literal same skin color with no subtle variation, unlike with humans.  Later in life a human who a tiger dragon gave birth to for a [human] family is likely going to be sexually attractive to a zarakite and be a good candidate for becoming a sky child, which changes their blended skin color to a more uniform one for the rest of their life, and comes with detachables and a different lifestyle.

Idea #1530:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  Some archaics throughout history who were criminal pedophiles would shave off all of the hair from their bodies and disguise themselves as a teenager when in fact they were well beyond their teenage years.  Some would even sign themselves up to be high school students and lie about their identities and ages and 'families' to register.  With zarakites and half dragon races, and their sky children as well, I think some humans will give themselves a youthful teenage-like appearance at times for very innocent social reasons, to hang with zarakites and half dragon people and also sky children, especially for sex.  This includes shaving armpit and pubic hair, and all other hair except for scalp hair and eyebrows and eyelashes.  I think this makes sense and simply makes sense.

Idea #1531:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  This one's going to step on a few toes for sure, but would probably come up at some point sooner or later.  I learned from Ron Marchie about African-American sub-culture and what a 'house nigger' is, before he died.  He had a good side that taught me a few things, and he was a white man who grew up in an urban ghetto that was high-crime.  Anyways, he told me about how 'blacks' would have their own internal sub-culture of sorts and value their variety of skin colors within their own with their own rules and their own ways.  I can't speak for them or their sex drives, as I'm the wrong race and wrong species, you'd have to ask a human, but I can say that as far as the zarakite sex drive goes, when a guy is young and attractive to the zarakite sex drive, often in teenage and childhood years, and they happen to be African American, darker skin is okay and is sexy and darker skin is actually preferred, and mid-dark all the way to pitch black works and is sexy to the zarakite sex drive, while if it is too light and is confused for a 'white guy' then that is ugly and unattractive to the zarakite sex drive.  Also, a lot of Caucasian White people are ammong what is sexy to the zarakite sex drive, but African Americans are as well.  East Indian and certain Arabic guys are very rare in being attractive to the zarakite sex drive, and not typically what I would masterbate over.  This has little to do with anyone's culture, mostly personal appearance and how people look and sound and sometimes act.  I'm just being straight and brutally honest with what is, not pulling any punches here and not sugar coating ANYTHING.  Anyways, if a Negro has very dark skin and is young and is attractive in other ways, his dark skin works great with the zarakite sex drive.  With other humans though, I can't help with that.  That's WAY outside of where I can do much.  What I can say is that if his skin is very dark naturally and he wants to apply for a job somewhere, and he wants personal references for a resume, if he doesn't have good luck getting humans who are willing to be listed for a reference he might have luck with zarakites and half dragons types and sky children in this future that may be real at some point.  Actually, this could happen for all humans, not just any one ethnicity.  With females it would be more rare and might be more often a 'friend of a friend' type of thing, as females are not as attractive to the zarakite sex drive and rarely are something a zarakite would masterbate over.  On the other hand those with a zarakite sex drive don't have any homosexual personality or the brain functions or thought process of a gay man and never did.  This was scientifically proven and well established already, and still holds true.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1537:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   19:31  EST :  When a compatible detachable is held up against a compatible body part, cap pressed against cap, the parts attach via reflex actions, quick and fast and painless, in a split-second, casual and easy and discomfort-free in itself, and of course pain-free as well.  Such makes a characteristic noise, from the flesh and bones and other body tissues rapidly shapeshifting and fusing together.  The detachables don't have to be perfectly lined up, and can be as much as 45 degrees off-kilter in any orientation, any combination of three axis.  When the parts shapeshift and attach, they automatically twist and line up perfectly, bones and skin and muscles and everything else.  When parts attach they don't have to end up in any specific posture, and often don't.  Heads do this with tops of necks as well.  The sensations that come with the shapeshifting of attaching and detaching body parts is at least mildly sexually stimulating, though still often within self-control of even a zarakite.  An erection from multiple acts of shapeshifting, one right after another, within a few moments of time, is common.  Zarakites and draco people as well as sky children often have sex in locker rooms, changing bodies and body sizes and muscle sizes, shapeshifting, healing and regrowing body parts, detaching and discarding worn and injured body parts, milking, water and rinsing and grooming, sexual stimulation, etc.

Idea #1574:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   21:25  EST :  The feathers of wings of a zarakite are natural and feel comfortable and pleasant to the touch and feel of the zarakite as well as that of other people of all races and all genders.  As imagined and desired by the immortal of Earth they also secrete natural odorless pheromones that mildy stimulate sexual arousal in all people of all genders and all races, other than the zarakite, and stimulate teenage boys of all races to masterbate over the idea of having sex with a zarakite and ideas of such sex making both of their bodies' parts attach and detach.  Such pheromones also stimulate liking the idea of and masterbating over the idea of one's head detaching and milking a zarakite.  None of the stimulated ideas include any rectal intercourse of any kind at all whatsoever.  None of the stimulated ideas include any idea of sexual harassment or social power or influence from sexual acts at all whatsoever either.  All zarakites have a zarakite sex drive and no other sex drive.  This is normal and healthy and life-long for all zarakites.  All zarakites are naturally sexually attractive to the zarakite sex drive.  All zarakites lack all qualities that are ugly to the zarakite sex drive.  All of this altogether conforms with part of but not all of the imagined ideas and desires of the immortal of Earth which concidentally have a destiny and future to stop any mind controller invasion and prevent further mind controller invasions and bring about health and Paradise and pleasure for the many of Earth who not only survive but thrive and live well and happily with the many things involved.  'Nuffs said.  This and the previous three Ideas as well make sense and altogether simply make sense.

Idea #1575:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   21:25  EST :  Natural hair colors for zarakites and draco races and sky kids combined are blond, blue, red, purple, blue-blond, purple-blond, orange, black, magenta, and white.  These are 'sky boy' or 'punk' colors.  This makes 10 (ten) total colors.  For some it helps to mentally associate the 'purple' colors with 'grape'.  For 'purple' I personally use one side of the updated newer SwiftWing tribal logo, not the older one.  The 'blue' is also the intense 'exosolar blue' as well as a 'sky boy blue' color and also an extreme 'digital blue' that isn't light or dark.  The 'psychic blue' that Haldeman's eyes were at one point were too dark and were a dark blue color, the wrong blue.  What the guy at the grocery store had was perfect, dead-on accurate.  Looking at the most recent information, Cobalt faced zarakites will have red-red hair, Gold faced zarakites will have blond-blond hair, Almandine faced zarakites will have natural blue-blond hair, Prismatic faced zarakites will have natural blue-blue hair, Diamond faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Jet faced zarakites will have natural purple-purple hair, Cheetah faced zarakites will have natural red-red hair, TigerStone faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Jade faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Volcano faced zarakites will have natural red-red hair, Iolite faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Leopard faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Emerald faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Graphite faced zarakites will have natural magenta-magenta hair, Copper faced zarakites will have natural red-red hair, and Matrix faced zarakites will have natural blue-blue hair.  Whatever face is named after and based on 'Brian Wegel' will have natural purple-blond hair when it is the natural face of a zarakite.  Last time I checked there are multiple vacancies in the list of one hundred faces.  If Dan Bier is an issue because of the insect thing then we can let him go and fill his spot, by the way.  Also pinched nose nostrils as I'm calling them for the moment are unsexy to the zarakite sex drive.  The same with noses that are too long, as I would want to describe them and would want to have them understood.  All of this, combined with Idea #1571 through Idea #1574 and this Idea as well, altogether makes sense and altogether simply makes sense.

Idea #1576:
     2020-02-14    Common-Era   12:42  EST :  Over the years I've always had a general difficulty remembering people's names.  Over the years, in general, I've always been good at remembering what people's physical faces look like to my eyes and sense of sight.  Often I would remember someone without rememering their name.  The cops I worked with at Tri-C knew this and so did many professors as well as schoolteachers at more than one school.  The campus police knew that I would remember people by what they looked like including themselves at times, both when I was starting to work with them as well as when they had someone from Metro or administration stop by.  Leia, the student assistant who was working there when I started, who was identified as a Sallyist, suggested that I try to get to know the cops who would be my co-workers by their badge numbers first.  Deans and administrators as well as law enforcement understood I was good at remembering and imagining what people's faces looked like quite easily, and I had a reputation and pretense for such, and this was normal for me and also what others expected me to be like over the years, regardless of whatever medications were and were not involved.  Not being able to visualize or imagine any face I want to at any time quite easily and accurately is unheard of with myself and outside of what I'm known for by many.  I've had many accuse me of being a spy of some sort as well as some sort of undercover replacement for David Reeves while allegedly being someone else, and the real David Reeves wouldn't have any 'filters' as described in discussions, or difficulties easily and quickly imagining any face he wants to.  The real David Reeves wouldn't imagine any disfigured or distorted or blurred or unclear versions of any face, and never did such things.  I know that this is all honest and consistent for many years and decades and is simply true and there's no way around it, and two-and-a-half years of foot patrol being accounted for honestly depend upon it, including conversations with the cops in the office over people watched and observed and also a conversation with an administrator who worked with one of the deans.  That one dean was a weirdo and had a 'thing' for me, as if he was telepathic or something, and seemed to have his own ideas, and picked up on mine, and reacted to what I would imagine when I went to that campus and not just for classes.  He would know what I can and can't imagine easily and how, if I'm actually David Reeves and not some imposter or joke of some sort.  I know this one has to be taken and can't be refuted, not unless you discredit a lot of cops and brass and telepaths and good operators and others with them, and their versions of my track record.  Contrary to what former FBI Director Stephen D Anthony said in one discussion, or someone representing him, changes to my imagination were NOT discussed and NO ONE went over any instructions or what I should expect with me, ever.  Not at Cleveland Clinic, not before that, not after.  Never ever.  See why I keep asking for the instruction manual I never got, once in a while?  This is not a game and I am not being playful, and I am not bemused.  I don't find this funny at all.  This is not playacting or pretending and I am upset and still demanding the first-time instructions along with what I should know that I never got.  I'm sick of others thinking I got the introduction already along with instructions.  Perhaps I should be given the instructions and proper introductions anyways, and a start-over, even if anyone thinks I don't need it.  Maybe start with what a 'spirit phone' is and what I should expect with my imagination and memory and what these things have to do with each other.  Oh and I recall one back office discussion with the cops I worked with about the 'thought police' and how they wanted to implement that, back then.  It was a VERBAL discussion, ordinary and plain, and we have a lot to catch up on, myself and a bunch of idiots that think I already know the ropes of some manual I never got and don't have.  It was a restricted verbal discussion, off-limits at the time to civilians, at the time, but that's changed since then, I've been told and educated, and I've been told I'm authorized and cleared to talk to whomever I want to about it, and so is anyone else.  No it isn't a smartphone app in anyone's head.  This altogether makes sense and altogether simply makes sense.

     2020-02-14    Common-Era   15:18  EST :  I just had a conversation with one or more 'operators' of some kind who talked about a 'pretend spy agency' that I've never heard of and don't understand or know anything about.  One of them was shocked as they explained that 'no data file was declared' or something, meaning no operator or guide of any religion or with any spirit phone ever discussed any pretend spy agency with me or told me what it is or what it has to do with me or any of the Reeves family or dark hearted or mind controllers or anything.  I've been accused of being an actual real-life spy for a real spy agency or real non-civilian agency of some sort, possibly post or pre Soviet Russian, such as KGB or something, and there have been real actual authorities checking me out with logic that says that if I really was David Reeves then I would know all about a pretend spy agency and also a lot of other stuff I never heard of.  I just had at least one operator probe my brain telepathically to see if I knew anything about this 'pretend spy agency' and 'the project' whatever that is and they were shocked and astonished that things they were expecting to come up didn't, and that I'm not kidding or playing games about these things.  I relaxed my head and tried to think no thoughts and be passive and permissive for a bit and that's what happened.  No wonder the real actual CIA and then some have been involved and checking to see if I'm an undercover spy for someone or not.  I'm still clueless and I don't know how this helps fight any mind controllers or fix any problems regarding any mind control invasion or anyone running around with thought control technologies causing problems, or fix broken failsafe teams, but I suspect this stuff must be over and done with before that stuff can happen.  I still have a few that call me 'boss' even though I'm a civilian and they know it.  I didn't ask to be in charge by the way and actually don't know how this ended up happening in the first place or exactly what I'm supposed to be in charge of, either.  It sounds like some have a lot of explaining to do in their offices where I don't work, conversations I'm not a part of and shouldn't be a part of, over this.  Then again, maybe it's because of my unique situation.  That's just a guess, as I can't imagine they would do this for any human, doing this with a civilian who has never heard of this stuff before a few years ago and thought he simply had a hard life with abusive parents and had no idea why one of them had their eyes glow an odd color with a dark blue ring the way it did one night, or what that meant, and the same dark blue ring on John Haldman's eyes and he turned out to be possessed by an insect species that was just as evil and just as sneaky and dishonest and deceptive.  I'm still playing guessing games here, still winging it, and going with what I think simply makes the most sense.  I think I've been treated unfairly.  What about all of the telepathic stuff in my old apartment with a gun in a holster and then the bathroom mirror and being arrested by some policeman squad that never came?  What about the gun clip that Matthew Damron wanted turned into a money clip for dollar bills?  Is that related?  No insect of any species from any world answered or explained these things, and no 'blackey honesty' group as it called itself and named itself answered these things or even mentioned them for discussion, ever, not with me at least.  Another group that called itself 'blackey corruption' didn't do any better.  Hey, these names sound racist, but are names THEY came up with and they called themselves these names!  Whether or not anyone put them up to it, I don't know.

Idea #1578:
     2020-02-14    Common-Era   15:18  EST :  One of the favorite and highly effective methods of the dark triad is to leave me clueless and unknowing and out of all planning regarding as much as possible, while working in the role of pretend allies as well as any pretend family and-or friends.  Being left out of knowing about the death of Uncle Ted until well after his funeral and long after his will was read and probate court was over and done with it, very deliberate of the dark trio, is one example.  Every single so-called 'family vacation' is another example of this, when all three of them deliberately plan the daily agenda and how long the vacation will be and big and little things, all without me being part of any discussion about those types of things, very intentionally and very carefully.  They've always done this over the years and decades.  Included is how they pretend and lie and claim that I was supposedly included and part of all planning.  They've done that quite frequently over the decades as well, both before and after the turn of the century, every time an act of evil and hostile deception.  These types of things are in their values, dark hearted trio values, their methods and their ways, very evil, and very hostile to zarakite values, always.  Their evil values are evil to planet Earth as well.  Who knows what they have in store for planet Earth as well as any allies of planet Earth?  How about the human race and any who would keep them around for anything?  Humans aren't the best, but the immortal of Earth wants them for his own plans and for planet Earth, as opposed to them going extinct and suffering any pain or punishment or anything instead.  Once again, duplicating and copying the evil methods and ways of the dark hearted trio does evil and does in the planet and human beings.  This is still proving itself and I rest my case.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1579:
     2020-02-15    Common-Era   22:46  EST :  My modeling and animation skills both suck.  I can't create models of zarakites in Blender software very accurately, not even with my best efforts which span multiple years of modelling and animating.  Animating them isn't any better.  The closest I've gotten to what really makes me happy, at least by comparison to the other stuff, is the head and face which is very close to a TigerStone face, shown in a lot of renders.  I've been trying to create a face at least that is photorealistic.

Idea #1580:
     2020-02-15    Common-Era   22:46  EST :  I think the mohawk haircut that I really want, for a lot of the faces and models and zarakites, won't be quite like the bristles of a broom, but will be many numerous small spikes, with straight individual hairs that grow thick and numerous, from many hair folicles per square centimeter of parts of the scalp, very dense growth, so that no spikes or hair have to be combed inward at all to keep the hair style stable.  Also, the spikes and hair and actual complete style stays styled even in high winds and high-speed dives from high altitudes, and springs completely back into shape quickly and naturally and an unlimited number of times when exposed to greater wind and-or stress.  No hair gel or hair spray or other styling product is ever needed, a press to the navel makes the hair style's spikes stick out and be stiff and strong and springy as described.  The average length of the spikes is adjustable, with pressing the navel, from about 5 centimeters to about 50 centimeters and every length in-between, with the back and other parts of the 'fan' of the 'hawk overall about as long as the top, generally.

Idea #1581:
     2020-02-15    Common-Era   23:51  EST :  The dark hearted queen [we know who she is, and what her name is by now, certainly] will sometimes speak with a lot of emphasis on specific syllables and one-syllable words, that repeat, with a lot of forcefulness and emphasis that comes with a massive amount of mental focus and energy, sometimes with small but energetic impulsive hand and finger motions and breathing, like a martial arts kiai [like in kata and fighting, look it up, it has high relavance and zarakites do swordfighting and flying kicks with thrust with a dragon's roar when lunging and diving and should know this word like the back of their hands] that comes with her repeated word, a word which is often a word such as 'must' and the words 'have' and 'to' one after another which are very convincing and easily make human beings think the fate of the world is dependant upon something trivial as a so-called 'emergency', and quickly mind control the human brain easily with said technique.  No wonder she's psychic.  This is one of her methods and it simply works, fast and effective with the way she does it.  Doctors and nurses fall for it with a 100 percent rate of failure to think clearly and resist or even suspect anything.  Any nearby witnesses don't typically suspect a thing, from what I've seen, and as far back as I can remember instantaneously fall for her psychic spell in numbers simultaneously left and right, and she doesn't seem to have to work very hard to make it happen.  She's also well-practiced in this technique, having used it so many times that she's honed it to an art and uses it effortlessly, knowing exactly what she's doing.  She already had this much skill many years ago, long before Type Five, from what I've witnessed and remember.  The psychic effect and attack is so strong that no one ever asks questions or second-guesses or dares to consider cross-examining her, and they take it like an 'of course' type of thing, deluded and charmed, weird and trance-like, zealot-like, yet act like they think they are being obvious and practical with an implied 'of course' type of attitude.  Humans who are victims of her become like this in the blink of an eye.  It happens very fast and is alarming to witness and watch if one is completely immune to it.  If only I had a camera, but with footage that itself would be safe for a human to watch.....  This is so real and can be confirmed, yet I'll say that this isn't a game character of any typical sort, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1582:
     2020-02-16    Common-Era   17:31  EST :  Regarding Salt, Salt has a natural magic and is a real actual esoteric that isn't 'f---ral magic' but instead the real thing, that enforces and educates and other stuff when I eat salt and foods that contain salt.  When I am denied extra salt as any sort of condiment or otherwise, salt becomes more powerful and works with the salt that is already in foods I eat listed as 'sodium' on ingredient labels, and while more powerful does more than otherwise and has a justified right to do more that doesn't break rules and isn't unfair, as punishment for otheers for me being denied salt that I would put on and-or in foods I eat.  This I think especially happens when human beings left and right are being childish and immature about denying me salt.  Salt as I understand it goes back to normal behavior when I get salt packets or cans of salt or other forms of extra salt.  Salt uses it's own rules as to whether or not I reasonably have extra salt or not, as well as whether or not I reasonably TRY to get extra salt or not, and I use the same rules.  Salt by the way is a very common reagant and ingredient in various witchcraft rituals that go back over decades and centuries and longer, representing Earth in serious-minded witchcraft and magic-embracing religions.  Seax-Wica is one example, though seax-wica only goes back to the 1950s and 1960s.  When I am denied extra salt the salt that is already in foods I eat is far more powerful and the overall effect of eating the food is greater.  Salt knows and enforces and works by zarakite values and even more by what I want and a bit less with what I would hypothetically want in various situations.  Salt also has Japanese and Arabic as well as exosolar backing, regarding it's magic and these rules.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1583:
     2020-02-17    Common-Era   16:44  EST :  After just watching 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' on DVD, I thought I'd say what it means to zarakite values to be a real warrior who is in charge.  'Auntie' is the character played by Tina Turner, a character who became a warrior and leader and boss, and she as boss and leader of a whole town would go and fight on the front lines of a battle, including jumping off of a moving vehicle and onto another moving vehicle, fighting alongside her own front-line men as one of them as a true military leader and general should, and not like some gutless candy-a-- so-called 'general' of an Army that sits at a desk with a pen and a necktie and is too much of an unworthy gutless coward and wimp to ever touch a real gun and use it in the front lines of a real battle where co-workers are slain left and right, ever again.  The pen by the way is a simple 'helper tool' and crutch, and Auntie demonstrated that she doesn't need one.  She gives her orders and then they move out and she of course goes with them.  She's also anything but a 'has been' and she keeps in shape to fight, and she gets on the front lines and isn't afraid to see the whites of the eyes of her enemies.  She does this on any battlefield and also does this with prisoners of war that are captured, and she of course has more than enough guts to do it herself and it isn't like she has to try hard to have that courage.  She's used to that courage.  Now THAT is COURAGE I RESPECT ALMIGHTY and zarakite values say the SAME THING.  It's no wonder people of her town look to her as her being a fitting leader and boss, geez.  In my book, a military leader who refuses to go fight, themselves, on the front lines, where it is dangerous and allies are getting killed as facts of life, is no better than a whole squad that refuses to deploy and refuses orders and loses a battle or a war, belligerant and useless, and might as well be one of the enemy [and strategically, effectively is, technically and without any emotion as I and tactics see it].  Also related is how the rank or title 'Field Commander' is a two word term with the word 'field' NOT being 'dressing' or 'fluff' and of course being something of honor that must be backed by something literal, actually fighting on the battlefield and not from behind a desk or from an office.  'Commander' and the abbreviation 'Cmdr' sound nice, but 'Field Commander' always had a nice ring to it, and for a number of good reasons, including others as well that I don't explain here.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1584:
     2020-02-17    Common-Era   19:11  EST :  I don't have any mindset or personality for 'mind games' or psychological warfare or constant trickery with people left and right trying to outdo each other with super-intelligent tricks and manipulation.  I never did.  I also never wanted any brain or mind like that.  I hate the idea of people left and right being like that.  I hated that before and I hate that now and my hatred is the same.  I'm not cut out for any world or society where people are like that and never would be.  I'm cut out for a world where the guy who is phsycially quick and fast and wields a big stick or sharp sword always wins and always has the upper hand everywhere he is and the only way to compete or deal with that is to be like him and get your own club or sword and catch up with him and get big strong muscles and youth and be physically quick and fast with a lot more than martial arts.  THAT is what I still love and crave and want, for the world I live in and society as well.  That is what I would thrive in.  Police detectives and FBI like they are now have little to no place in that type of world unfortunately, but that's life.  The dark trio and those like them would hate that sort of world and not survive in it, not them or their evil ways.  I still hate mind games and am disgusted by them and am still not having fun or pleasure putting up with them.  Simplicity instead would be far better.  The immortal of Earth is upset and angry at all of this psychological super-mind-games trickery and is not bemused.  'Nuffs said.  This still altogether makes sense and still altogether simply makes sense.

Idea #1585:
     2020-02-17    Common-Era   19:33  EST :  I've always hated the world of what is psychic, mind reading and ESP, alternate states of consciousness, out-of-body experiences, channelling and mediumship, and guessing what cards someone else is staring at by reading their mind and figuring out if it is a square or wavy lines, etc.  I've always hated that crap and never been into it and would never want any lifestyle that involves that type of stuff.  The Dark Hearted Prince however would love that stuff and he does.  He really has a mind and personality for it.  I don't and never did and would never want that.  He can keep hhis mind and personality for it for all I care.  He also is an insult to witchcraft and what is actually magical, as what he calls 'magic' is subjective and is actually psychic and placebo effects that are psychological where people who are gullible might think that something is being influenced but a practical down-to-earth skeptic discredits it and debunks it right there before the delusion spreads.  I'm personally with the practical guy who debunks everything and is skeptical.  What I call magic leaves very real and very physical tell-tale signs that are mundane, like scorched marks from something being burnt, or a bathroom scale then a multi-million-dollar scale showing odd weight readings from an object with a spell cast upon it that can be measured but not reproduced with scientific instruments that scientists in lab coats and engineers can observe and record and document and publish their scientific findings on but cannot re-create, as they would explain in their documentary the public would watch and see isn't quackery or pseudo-science, as the scientists and engineers would take a very stoic and non-religious scientific approach with real methods and equipment that meets scientific standards and make credible measurements that would go in a public school textbook but not be able to recreate what they measure and document.  Real magic does that.  Psychic 'magic' and subjective crap doesn't and is a joke, and takes only a simple skeptic who has no science degree or expertise to debunk as delusion and nonsense.  I was actually frustrated with Wicca and related witchcraft as I wanted objective concrete results from spells and rituals that could be measured scientifically if I wanted, not any self-help feel-good-about-one's-self garbage which is actually what some of it turned out to be, no more than psychological state-of-mind crap and nonsense that I don't have faith or belief in.  I don't call that magic.  This is what I tried to explain several years ago and since then.  None of the three of the dark trio by the way believe in what I call magic.  Also I don't think they know how the ancient Egyptians built their pyramids the way they did but know it was documented and measured and some still stand today after how they made them.  I would not be surprised if they were built with what I and zarakite values call magic.

Idea #1586:
	Failsafe teams include racists and sexists etc for good reasons, to detect and identify certain types of mind controllers that charm others into being unable to hate or despise them for any reason, regardless of being professional and anyone keeping feelings to themselves.  The Dark Hearted Queen Sally Lynn Reeves tested positive for being a mind controller of this sort by at least two types of failsafe teams.  One was a group of African Americans who found that they were unable to hate her for being white.  The Dark Hearted Queen is Caucasian White.  She's also middle-aged, over 40 and over 60 years old actually.  One person from one failsafe teams hates the elderly and doesn't like people over a certain age.  He got exposed to what the Dark Hearted Queen looks like and sounds like in audio and video, and suddenly is unable to hate or dislike her.  The effect is instantaneous or near-instantaneous.  I personally would expect similar results from a group of male gender failsafe team members that hate the female gender and suddenly like or don't hate the Dark Hearted Queen.  The USA I've heard doesn't have enough failsafe team members to test this.  She tested positive with the other two types of tests I mentioned, though, easily.

Idea #1587:
     2020-02-21    Common-Era   09:56  EST :  Zarakites have arctic white skin as their natural and default skin color, no matter what their face looks like.  This is much like the render of a TigerStone faced zarakite, in the file 'TigerStone_Dragon_Sky_Boy_Age_5_Size_4.jpg'.  The natural and normal skin color for people of the half-dragon race kahjeet is also arctic white, and looks the same.  The same applies to the half dragon race 'Barracuda' which are reincarnations of what were originally sentient fish from a non-Earth world with a methane ocean that live short lives by human standards, about 5 (five) Earth years, and I'm told come from a high-gravity planet compared to Earth.  This is skin color 1 (one).  Griffons are a half-dragon race that always have a natural Caucasian skin color, and I'm currently not sure what number, but it would be from skin color 2 to skin color 4.  Natural hair colors for zarakites vary by face from the Book Of Faces and are always 'sky boy' or 'punk' colors.  The natural hair color for kahjeet of all faces is always 'sky boy red'.  The natural hair color for Barracuda is always 'sky boy blue'.  The natural hair color for griffons is always white.  Some zarakites look identical to certain half dragons when they are not wearing their wings, and this is normal.  Cheetah faced zarakites have 'sky boy red' hair and can be easily mistaken for kahjeet when they are not wearing their wings.  The only way to tell the difference is their growls and roars, and natural ID found in their wallets that are part of their natural clothing, and natural instincts that allow a boy to recognize the voice of one of his own family when blindfolded which works with half dragon [?] and zarakite families and also applies to intercourse as well as voice.  Griffons are winged, and can wear wings much like zarakites.  Griffons always have white feathers on their wings, arctic white in color.  Barracuda and kahjeet cannot grow or shapeshift to have wings.

Idea #1588:
     2020-02-21    Common-Era   19:55  EST :  Tiger dragons are magical beings of pleasure, and their personalities and magical natures and instincts simply are not the same as that of humans, and so neither are their work ethics or logic to their work versus play.  When they have a lot of fun and pleasure, not 'assigned' and not as a 'chore' or 'okay, now its scheduled playtime' stuff, but instead have it on their own terms, they are far more productive and useful, and so is the rest of their tribe and all who depend on their tribe.  Also, tiger dragons often agree on what they find fun and would call pleasure, and would want, 'nuffs said.  When a tiger dragon is lied to and misled for too long, and doesn't know what he is missing, and thinks he is content at least but is suffering massive lack of pleasure, he isn't very productive and couldn't work a job, and might be confused as to why.

Idea #1589:
     2020-02-21    Common-Era   19:55  EST :  Zarakites make and sell milk, their body parts, their magic [from eating enough food], raw building materials, and fireproof materials.  Also, with homes they build and own they charge rent.  This includes supercities.  They like and provide and provide for simple non-magical humans and their cultures, at least the youth culture parts of them.  They are dragons and in some explanations divine beings of youth and youthful fun and pleasure.  They are also natural hunters and warriors and fighters, and they do breath fire.  At the same time they are also children and adolescent boys by nature, including their personalities, as normal and healthy and responsible trusted teenagers, forever and eternal.  They get rowdy and rough and goof off once in a while, but know where the limits are of what is and isn't safe for them and others.  Looks can be misleading with this, as casual decapitation and dismemberment with smiles and laughs of having fun, from more than swordfighting, are very common, and well within what is safe and clean fun for them and sky children, as well as the half dragon races.  To an uneducated human they look like they are goofing off and very dangerous, but they are not, and if a human tries to join them with a sword they suddenly change and get very different and super-careful and super-serious by human standards.  They obviously see a difference between themselves and humans with what is and isn't safe.

Idea #1590:
     2020-02-23    Common-Era   12:16  EST :  Regarding instinctive pre-determined experience and experience, which are nature and nurture respectively, two zarakite sky dragons of both the common type of sky dragon [not a tiger dragon], which have the same face from the Book Of Faces, have the exact same pre-determined experience including vocabulary and slang terms and social skills, but experience that is accumulated life-long differs and makes the two zarakites different from each other.  This type of thing applies to all zarakites when matched up with another zarakite of the same type with the same face.  Also, the two zarakites from any match will have the same natural hair colors, and as a base body size naturally 'feel at home' with bodies that stand at the same height at the same ages.  Both have personalities that have some stuff the same, other stuff different, and a lot of stuff similiar.  This type of thing isn't the same for half dragon races or sky children, where two with the same face have voices that sound the same, and faces that look alike and have at least some of the same and similiar facial expressions, but what is expected to always be alike or close to it ends there.  Zarakite families find it very easy and quick to socially bond and make friends with each other, one family after another, and work together if desired very easily.

Idea #1591:
     2020-02-23    Common-Era   15:15  EST :  I finally just looked up the word 'rastafarian' on the Internet to find out what it means.  A religion that involves smoking weed, wearing dreadlocks, rejecting pork and milk and shellfish, Jamacian in origin, with blacks being 'chosen people' and connections to Africa.  It seems to me to be a religion that can't make up it's mind whether it is a serious-minded religion that one should respect or a 'joke religion' or 'mockery religion' like the flying spaghetti pot monster 'religion'.  The parts of it that seem more like a joke are the 'you gotta have dreadlocks and smoke weed and be cool, all the time...' parts and are hurting the parts of it that want to be serious-minded and respected as a real religion alongside mainstream religions.  Don't get me wrong, I get the idea of 'being cool' from that and actually like it as a style that some guys I'd like would have, minus the drug-using part, but that's my opinion.

Idea #1592:
     2020-02-23    Common-Era   16:49  EST :  Zarakites and griffons have a separate brain for their wings.  This wing brain is a brain that is also in TwinSky and constantly reads the minds of both the primary and secondary head brains.  It only controls wings, both of them, and not whether or not you are wearing your wings.  If you're a griffon or zarakite you'll also find that it has a mind of it's own, and if your hands are full carrying something and you would point to something in a conversation, your wing brain might make one of your wings unfold and stick out straight and point at what you would point at with your arm and hand.  That's normal.  It also makes your wings flutter and stretch and other stuff at times, when IT wants to, but when it makes your wings stretch it does feel good.  Also, you can feel your wings and what they touch, but you can't control them, but your wing brain feels and controls them.  Your wing brain noramlly reads your head brains really fast, and if you want to take off it makes your wings unfold and makes you take off and start flying where you wanted to fly really fast, split second with no delay that you can tell, and so fast there's no delay as far as any zarakite or griffon can ever tell.  If you're bored and thinking of taking off and waiting for someone you're talking to to finish what they are saying, your wing brain might give away what you're thinking by making your wings unfold and start to flutter a little, and the person will tell you 'Hey don't go anywhere yet!  I'm not done!'.

Idea #1593:
     2020-02-23    Common-Era   16:49  EST :  If you're not wearing any tounge, you can't talk, and you can't really eat [at least not the same], but you can yell and use your voice, and you don't smell anything at all, and don't have to put up with any bad smells.

Idea #1594:
     2020-02-23    Common-Era   16:49  EST :  Zarakites and sky children and people of half dragon races all have primary and secondary head brains.  The secondary brain always yields to the first brain which can control any detachables at any time including blindly.  The primary head brain always has sense of touch and feel but not pain or discomfort of certain types in all detachables [deflated and killed detachables don't count].  With this, with your head detached and in one room, and your headless body in another room, you can reach into your belly button with a hand and arm you still feel and think is attached to a belly you still feel and think know where it is, without seeing or hearing any of those parts, but feeling them.  The brain for the phallus usually yields to both head brains, but once in a while overrides both simultaneously in spurts with what can be multiple quick actions that include arms and legs and torso and not just the phallus, but not vocal cords or facial expressions.  The phallic brain feels the entire body.  The secondary head brain also feels the entire body and sees and hears through the two nipples of the chest.  The phallic brain uses the same two nipples to see and hear.

Idea #1595:
     2020-02-23    Common-Era   16:49  EST :  Human females, both archaics and traditionals, never have detachables and can never be turned into sky children.  Such is physically and biologically and scientifically impossible.

Idea #1596:
     2020-02-23    Common-Era   16:49  EST :  Only zarakites have heads that can be respawned.  Half dragon peoples and sky children as well as humans cannot grow new heads, life-long, and can heal and regenerate scars and wounds and disfigured features and teeth with sex with a zarakite or kahjeet.  Human boys between eight and sixteen-and-a-half have their heads and faces and eyes shape-shifted as a one-time-only thing if they become sky children although details are sketchy.

Idea #1597:
     2020-02-23    Common-Era   16:49  EST :  To update and correct, skin color 8 is a near-pitch-black, very dark and just lighter than pitch black enough that one can look at the skin of the chest of someone with it and their nipple [which would be pure pitch black] and tell the difference between the two colors.  Skin color 6 is an African American 'black' that is like that of the celebrity movie actor Eddie Murphy.  Skin color 7 is halfway in-between skin colors 6 and 8.  These are not monochrome or grey-scale colors, grey-scale dark near-pitch-black is skin color 10 and for zeros, and is slighty darker than skin color 6 and lighter than skin color 7 [halfway between the two] and is monochrome head-to-toe.  Skin colors 6, 7, 8, and 10 all lack pale areas on the palms of hands and bottoms of feet, and normally include the entire upper and lower lips of the face being pure pitch-black, as natural colors.  Hair that goes with these skin colors, ANY hair, is always naturally pure pitch black and is also naturally straight, and can be limp and straight, and straight like a black-haired Caucasian White guy's straight hair.

     2020-02-23    Common-Era   18:51  EST :  To update and correct, the diameter of shaft and end and other parts of the phallus of a zarakite's dragon-like phallus is about 3 (three) centimeters, consistent, and a cross-section is round and not oval-like at all when stiff and straight.

Idea #1599:
     2020-02-23    Common-Era   18:51  EST :  If you're not a human and you have a magic body that has zarakite dragon-like detachables, and you're from Earth, depending on what race you are you can attach someone else's detachables and use them as your own body parts, and later detach them [and possibly give them back] when you want to.  When attaching your head to any neck, if your head attaches then that neck and what is directly connected to it in three dimensions is controlled by you, your primary head brain and it's mind, and your brains, and not anyone else's brains.  That changes with someone elses body parts once they are detached again.  Also, you have sense of feel and touch with those parts while they are attached, and not who they belong to.  If you are a sky child you can attach the detachables of another sky child.  If you are a half dragon race guy you can ALSO [key word here, 'also'] attach the body parts of another half dragon race person.  If you are a sky dragon then you can also do the same with another sky dragon's parts [and that of any half dragon, and any sky child].  If you are a tiger dragon you can also do the same with that of another tiger dragon.  Higher up on this heiarchy is Zare, who is at the very top.  Attaching and detaching one's own body parts, and that of other people, is and feels natural and casual and comfortable, and is also a little bit at least stimulating, and is for a number of reasons, at home and work and school and pleasure and with friends and sports and more.  Culturally it doesn't come with any expectation or desire for privacy or secrecy or treating it like a swear word, at all, at least not by non-humans.  It isn't seen or felt as any sort of evil or 'necessary evil' or bad habit of any sort, and is actually the opposite.  Biologically is it very normal and casual and healthy and should be done, like exercise.

Idea #1600:
     2020-02-24    Common-Era   00:02  EST :  Heads on necks of zarakites and zarakite-blooded people do not 'dangle' or bob up and down, and are not loose like any 'bobble-head' at all whatsoever.  The head is either well-attached including muscles and bones and tendons and ligaments and connective tissues and more, or detached and completely loose.  When detached it is possible for a detachable to be sitting on top of another body part or a body and mistakenly look attached.  The process of attaching and detaching the head does not cause passing out or pain or discomfort or injury or dizziness.  It also doesn't prevent or stop breathing or one's voice from working, and as such can be done in the middle of speaking a sentence verbally.  When your head is detached and you take a deep breath your belly and chest move and get bigger and smaller and whatever in exactly the same ways they normally do when your head is attached.  The same is true if your chest and torso are detached whether or not your head is attached to your chest.  Other body parts are going to move and flex and still work the same no matter what is attached and detached in whatever combinations.  Where one part ends and the other would begin, a detached part has a 'cap' which is simply flawless healthy unbroken plain skin.  Everything still works and moves and flexes and nothing dies, because of tethering which goes beyond three dimensions and connects things to TwinSky and back and TwinSky is in another dimension that can't be reached from Earth and traveling in only three dimensional space.  The extra dimensions involved do not include time, and time in TwinSky is in sync with and moves at the same speed as reality that includes real life of planet Earth.  The extra dimensions are custom.  The elves know what that means and they told me that TwinSky and this extra-dimensional stuff and tethering was already justified and needed irregardless for other reasons outside of the immortal of Earth's wants and desires, and has to be done, and so we might as well take advantage of it and do stuff that uses it, at 'Shape-Shifters-R-Us' and a bunch of other stuff.  This I'm told makes sense.

Idea #1601:
     2020-02-24    Common-Era   02:01  EST :  There are ways to identify zarakites and other guys with zarakite blood, and their body parts, including if they are separated into more than one piece with detachables.  The pelvis, which has the hips and groin and buttocks etc, is what natural legwear and a natural wallet chain with a natural wallet containing a natural ID inside always grows out of, which is always unique.  With an ID being torn off of the inside as a routine way to check someone's ID, which by the way is painless and lacks blood and isn't something he even feels, IDing him by his natural ID is easy and reliable.  DNA and fingerprints actually work, and the body gets better at regrowing the same body parts to perfection with less flaws every time a body part is regrown, perfect with respect to DNA, including fingerprints and lines of the palms of the hands and underside sides of the fingers.  One can detach their hand and leave it as proof of identity and regrow a new hand right after detaching the one he had.  He can do this with both hands, one at a time, of course.  His teeth always regrow and fall out and replace themselves, but would only ID what face he has from the Book Of Faces and also tell what age he was at the time a tooth fell out or was spat out or otherwise somehow left lying around.  What was called 'familial connection' in discussions and might be a misnomer could apply to his body hearing what his voice sounds like, hearing himself with his nipples, so if he [his headless body] has his head detached he can tell when his head is talking and tell the difference between his own head and the head of someone else who has the same face from the Book Of Faces and might be the same age at the time [?].  This term used in discussions is also how zarakites of a tribe recognize each other by voice, blindfolded, including dragon-like purrs and roars and growls as well, and is much like how penguins in Antarctica recognize their mate once a year and breed with the exact same penguin after a whole year goes by isolated from the penguin they breed with and there are several hundred penguins gathered together when they do that, all making noise in a big crowd all at once, according to some documentary science show about how their natural instincts and hearing work.  Zarakites of the same tribe can also identify each other specifically from having intercourse with each other, and also from milking each other [?].  Also, speaking of other ways to ID someone, sky children do not have fangs or fingerclaws.  Zarakites and half-dragons always have fangs, four of them total, which do not retract, and are visible when they open their mouths to talk and yawn and eat etc.  Zarakites also have fingerclaws, claws that extend via shape-shifting from their fingertips and are anchored to the bones of the fingertips, and are very sharp horizontal blades that also pierce as well as slash, and are not the same as the fingernails.  When they are fully retracted they leave no markings or signs, and leave only ordinary skin of the fingertips, no bumps or discoloration.  Fingernails by the way of detachable hands and gloves are always short like how guitar players like most of their fingernails, and never grow, and stay short, and if one gets damaged the whole hand is discarded and replaced [you just grow a new one, literally].  Zarakites can try putting their own fingertips and thumbtips into the navels of another guy they think might be from their tribe and see if they can do something to that guy that they could only do to someone else of their tribe or not, and see if they get lucky [or a weird stare].  They could also consider that clones are everywhere and many dragons and half-dragons look and sound the same and can have only about a hundred possible faces and paired voices, no matter how many zarakite tribes and half dragon families there are, and realize that everyone else also puts up with this from time to time, and simply ASK rather than beat around the bush and make themself and idiot and total dork about it ['Hey, are you John?' then 'Sorry, thought you were someone else.' is very innocent and happens to everyone all the time when you think about it.  So is something like 'Hi, you my buddy Vermin?' and probably 'What the hell kind of a name is "Vermin"?' and 'I get that a lot' which follows ALL THE TIME.].

Idea #1602:
     2020-02-24    Common-Era   05:51  EST :  Tiger dragons can simultaneously borrow up to all four of the torsos and arms and hands/gloves/paws of their extra four heads, while at the same time wearing their own torso.

Idea #1603:
     2020-02-24    Common-Era   18:53  EST :  There might be five half dragon races, including the automatons known as zeros as the fifth.  Tree can become the fourth, after kahjeet and barracuda and griffons.  What tree becomes will need a name.  Of the four, they might need to be both magical and psychic, magical with their TK that is of course zarakite magic and tethering and perhaps other zarakite magic, and psychic in spiritual connections to maintain all life and all things inanimate of Earth in origin as being uninfected, and prevent anything from becoming psychic that should not be psychic.  These five half dragon races would be dependant upon intercourse with zarakites, at least once a year or once every five years each, to survive, which must be pleasure and fun for the zarakite in however it is done for it to work properly.  These things are tentative.

Idea #1604:
     2020-02-24    Common-Era   18:53  EST :  Female traditionals don't have a vagina but instead a spot between the legs, a permanant spot of arctic white skin, in addition to any other spot or spots on their bodies used for sexual intercourse, which shape-shift as needed for a penis to go into that spot, and the penis can be that of a traditional as well as a half dragon as well as a dragon person.  When ejaculation comes from any half dragon or dragon, as long as the whole experience is fun and pleasure for them then there is healing that comes with every ejaculation pulse that regenerates and heals and shape-shifts the traditional's anatomy, head to toe, and also brain tissues.  This healing is greater and far more rapid when the sex comes from zarakites.  The healing is painless and stimulating and refreshing with each ejaculation pulse, and always feels good.  This healing works with the spots and any inside-out penises of male traditionals as well, and any inside-out penises of any half dragons, to heal all traditionals and all half-dragons [their heads and skulls and brains need this from time to time], and the brains and minds of zarakites as well.  Daily and routine sex can be with the penis of any male, including a traditional, with any spot and any inside-out penis.  Traditional males have penises that get erect going inside-out as well as right-side-out when they are ages eight to sixteen-and-a-half, which shows that they can potentially become sky children.  Sky children are capable of a lot of sex and have penises that always get erect both ways, life-long, and are a lot of fun and pleasure to have sex with in various ways.  Their penises don't heal but they are capable of a lot more frequent sex than traditionals, life-long.  Sky children and all half dragons and all zarakites can have detachables.  So can Zare.  Traditionals of both genders cannnot.  Also, some traditional humans are born with arctic white skin and natural hair color that is some sky boy hair color.  These are offspring of tiger dragons and have destinies to become sky kids, and when left human don't age past sixteen-and-a-half.  All half dragons and zarakites and sky children and Zare have natural 'cat's eyes' and all traditionals have human-looking eyes with 20-20 vision that is healthy.  All 'cat's eye' eyeballs have better than 20-20 vision and good low-light vision.  Dropped are outdated 'infravision' and 'ultravision' concepts except for Tai Tenga.  All zarakite skin and natural clothing and feathers and body parts are naturally fireproof.  Wings and feathers always involuntarily regenerate quick and fast and split-second so that no altitude is lost, except for when the wings are completely 'taken off' [degenerated], which of course includes the feathers.  When wings of a zarakite are worn but folded, they are visible when the zarakite is standing up straight with arms at his sides, from all angles, front and sides and behind, and behind his shoulders they extend above his shoulders but not his head, and are visible to the left and right of his head to someone standing in front of him.  Griffons have wings and feathers that fold and flex the same as that of zarakites.  Zarakite wings are highly flexible and not much more than large flat skin folds which flex with TK and no bones or skeleton, and have feathers and blood vessels inside.  There is only one layer of feathers, not two, to correct from the renders, but the outstretched flat shape that shows maximum wingspan is the same.  Griffon wings and feathers are the same in these regards.  They might or might not regenerate as fast or the same or different as that of zarakites [?].  Zarakites can fly just as fast and hard regardless of their muscle size.  At age 5 and size 5 they can fly up to about 500 kph or 310 mph in a straight line, level flight, and slow flying and gliding varies and includes sustained hovering, casually, and also includes hovering like a helicopter and moving backwards and sideways and straight up and down.  For griffons the normal top speed for sustained level flight is 450 kph or about 280 mph in a straight line.  When a sky dragon ejaculates himself accross a room or field or area, his penis can go up to 100 meters long.  For tiger dragons the maximum length is 250 meters.  This only works with a dragon penis.  These lengths are also maximums for stinging, which impales and kills wildlife and enemies, used in hunting and combat.  The penis tip won't drill holes when stinging but will shape-shift to have a sharp point and pierce like a spear or arrow tip.

Idea #1605:
     2020-02-24    Common-Era   22:47  EST :  I never could do things like roll my Rs.  I could never manage to make it work with my tounge or face or voice.  Tiger's Eye Jade SwiftWing as envisioned can do stuff like that easily though.

Idea #1606:
     2020-02-26    Common-Era   14:17  EST :  Empaths, of all of the types that there are that use zarakite values, need to be involved in all discussions, and need to have credibility and chances to be speak and listened to, and need to be allowed to speak in plain English among other things.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1607:
     2020-02-26    Common-Era   15:57  EST :  According to zarakite values, hunting is okay and can be fun and pleasure, as long as the corpse of what is hunted is put to good use [eaten, typically, and hide and body parts could be used but zarakites have their own they can use instead, and prefer their own, and prefer to hunt the animal only for the food it's corpse brings].  The animal should not be hunted simply for a trophy or to make a puppet or statue out of it's corpse [humans again may disagree, but to be fair according to zarakite values don't use their own skin or body parts for technology or tools].  A hunted animal should not be tortured as part of hunting or killing it, and should generally not suffer unnecessary pain as part of being hunted.  Also, hunting any animal's population in a local area to extinction is generally evil according to zarakite values.  According to zarakite values, killing an animal in self-defense is typically okay [except for felines] but if there is any harvesting or eating of the corpse it turns into being considered hunting.  A hunted animal's corpse should not be completely thrown out or wasted, unless it is sick or diseased.

Idea #1608:
     2020-02-26    Common-Era   18:36  EST :  Zarakites and half dragons and sky children are very loose and careless, by nature, about their detachable body parts.  It's very easy for them to regrow new body parts to replace the old ones, and very easy to re-attach the old ones as well, and very easy and casual to attach a part someone else was using.  Their body parts are really disposable, quick and often and easy.  If whole then separated into as many detachables as possible, starting with a zarakite one gets - the head, the chest, the torso down to the waist, the pelvis and hips, the phallus, the left arm, the right arm, the left hand, the right hand, the left leg and foot, the right leg and foot, each layer of natural clothing legwear [up to five], each layer of natural clothing shirts and jackets and upperwear [up to five], the tounge, the left eye, the right eye -.  Wings are not detachables.  They are very social and extroverted at times, and over time they naturally accumulate extra body parts from themselves when they hang around in an area, which is really good for nature as every body part they don't ever reattach will shape-shift into many magical worms after 24 hours which are very good for the Earth and eat and digest pollution as well as what worms normally eat, and when they die they decompose and leave what is healthy for the planet for whatever climate and terrain they are in [they shape-shift into the right type of worms to do these things].  They only live a month at the most [?].  Body parts, when attached to another person, are compatible with another who is of the same age [one to five] and the same size [one to five], and this practice is common and casual and easy, and not repulsive or disgusting at all, and is among things that they have fun with and even goof off with at times, and not something that they are squeamish about.

Idea #1609:
     2020-02-27    Common-Era   01:19  EST :  I still have no reliable or trustworthy or non-hostile guides or stage actors that I know of for William Zegas or any that were with his group.  All I have are compromized hostile stage hands/actors that are 'dorkies' and come with sound effects and spitting saliva through the air and are dark hearted and dark trio in nature, and they are not cooperative.  I've wanted and asked that brand new groups that don't behave like that step in and take their place, and reinvent the wheel by doing the research all over again and without any interaction with the 'dorkies' as the self-titled Dorkies that love the name they gave themselves are too toxic and psychically infectious and too dangerous.  The THOUGHT READING PROGRAM is to be opened up again and research is to be done over again that their group did, but by new people.  The new people cannot and will not use any 'dorkies' or stage hands/actors or transmorphs that have any likeness of any 'dorky' or anyone socially inept or anyone who spits or anyone who talks in a 'chipmunk from Alvin and the Chipmunks' cartoon voice, or anyone that generates or comes with the sound effects or hair styles or lab coats that the 'dorkies' often had.  In addition there was a professor who was very important who was involved and in some ways still is, who cannot and should not be affiliated with any of these 'dorkies' either, which are in some ways mockeries of him and are very dangerous.  I don't think he wanted or would have wanted them either.  I refuse to have any discussions with any 'dorky' about Billy Zegas, and insist that other guides who are not like them answer questions and say things about Billy Zegas instead.  If other guides and other stage actors don't know everything then that is okay, and I hope they get caught up in research and do their homework on William Zegas and other people in the same group rather soon.  William Zegas was and still is a natural blond who comes from a particular group and bloodline.  Yes, data that I never got and we never went over has to be destroyed and thrown out and the work that was done to get the data has to be done over again.  The data was put through the wrong hands and corrupted and tainted and compromised, and is too contaminated and too dangerous.  Yes the same work has to be repeated.  Real life is like that sometimes.  Welcome to the universe and real life, and how things work in the real world.

Idea #1610:

Idea #1611:
     2020-02-27    Common-Era   01:19  EST :  The Cents are increasingly being evil bullies and are enemies of this universe and all other universes that exist.  They have had far too much leverage over everyone's head and have been far too powerful and too uncooperative and are bullies that support only their way and no other.  Their ways are also evil and more recently it is really starting to show.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1612:
     2020-02-28    Common-Era   09:23  EST :  I've seen plenty of stage actors guess my personality and depict what they seem to think is my thought process and what goes on inside my head, with terrible results that are nowhere near accurate.  One of the biggest misunderstandings and misconceptions of all is a wrong assumption that I supposedly like to be socially inept or am supposedly content with being socially inept, or even want to be socially inept.  This could not be any more wrong and inaccurate.  It baffles me that any sane individual would ever like or enjoy or even be okay with being socially inept.  I've noticed that the 'Dorkies' also seemed to be happy and content and accepting of being social misfits and even made themselves proud of it at times, of all things.  That's one thing of many that scares the s--- out of me about them and how insane and mentally ill and DANGEROUS they are, especially with them in charge of anything and with any power or authority in their hands, and a very serious-minded concern at that which is not part of any jokes or humor or game of any kind, but dead serious.  Being socially inept and being content or happy about it is madness and insanity and isn't the slightest bit healthy, and is found I think in victims of the dark hearted trio and dark hearted.  It's also damn evil.  Zarakite values agree.  The zarakite sex drive doesn't find such evil madness the slightest bit sexy, not at all, and instead wants to sting and KILL such evil, thank you.  If there is ANY 'safe dork' of any kind, it would be a person who HATES being a dork and is NEVER accepting or content in being socially inept, not in youth and not later in life either, and a 'safe dork' that isn't dark hearted and infectious realizes and understands and is realistic in that if they are socially inept when young they are going to have a rough and difficult life and be less capable than others in career and life and there's no way around it and they might as well be realistic and not self-delusional or in any denial about it.  On the other hand that of course doesn't mean they can be crybaby about it either, as that's also mentally ill and pathetic, and deserves to be blasted away with both barrels, and doesn't survive, and is the WRONG way to handle it.  Personally I already figured that out a long time ago, before high school even started.  I also never liked what I was or became, or accepted it, or found myself happy-to-be and sing-song and delusional-in-la-la-land about it in my head either.  Never ever.  No f---ing way.  Talk about what would be mentally ill, yikes.  Also, don't even start with people who talk in Kermit-the-frog and muppet voices out-loud, especially those that do it by choice and think they are entertaining.  Those f---ers are really sick and demented, evil and really messed up.  That's nothing new of course.  I learned that the very first time I was ever exposed to such a person, and never changed my mind, because I'm SANE, thank you.  There is of course a reason that Teenage Target Culture mocks Barney the Dinosaur as one of the most messed up things of all time and also calls it 'gay'.  Duh.  Mentally retarded people are not the slightest bit charming or cute with their retard voices, but don't seem to be able to understand that, because of how messed up they are.  It's called being 'retarded', as well as 'mentally ill'.  It's also repulsive and drives others away, for understandable reasons.  Then no one wants to save or go back for a useless retarded person in the wilderness.  That's normal, it's part of natural selection, so that you don't have retarded people in the population or gene pool, or some government disability budget that the rest of society pays for.  Don't interfere with natural selection or overcome it with any evil medical.  Let it happen.  That's how it is and should be on planet Earth.  The socially inept do not and should not survive natural selection and should not be in the populations in large numbers, and are kept out of friendships and fun for good reason, so they don't mess up the gene pool and don't perpetuate in offspring and future generations.  That's normal and the way it should be on Earth.  Let it happen and work properly.  If you are from Earth and a sentient, and happen to be socially inept, you catch up and you TRY and never get suicidal by giving up.  That's life.  Teenagers and children in school figure that out at a young age, and have it right, and of course it matters.  Employers are not that open-minded, and won't hire someone who gives up and says hello in a job interview with a retard voice, at least not for any good position.  If such a person gets hired, they are expendable of course, as if I needed to point that out.  This isn't rocket science, this wisdom and insight is pre-junior-high-school stuff, and continues life-long of course.  Rejecting it leads to 'Uh, now that isn't very appropriate [regarding what you just did].  Now go sit down over there [and be quiet, and don't bother us anymore], and your [psychiatric] nurse will be with you...'  In junior high school and high school, they slam you into lockers and walls, simple, direct, and effective, as well as well-justified, it simply works.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1613:
     2020-02-28    Common-Era   09:23  EST :  Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche said 'What does not kill me, makes me stronger.'  That's for mortals.  If it were applied to immortals and situations that a mortal would not survive, it would be an unfair cheat code that everyone and all universes would overall complain about and say is unfair, and as such refuse to tolerate or allow.  This is also why throwing an immortal under a bus doesn't make them powerful and doesn't work, and is an evil and wrong thing to do.  This is also why bullying an immortal and trying to 'squeeze them until they pop' doesn't work either and is also a wrong and evil and bad thing to do.  Logic and common sense, as well as zarakite values, understand this entire Idea and agree with this entire Idea.  Also in agreement is reality and how things work in real life and not in this universe alone but in many including this one.  'Nuffs said.

Plain English DOES work and IS ALWAYS an option, even if telepathic, 'nuffs said.  Those who fight these rules are enemies of zarakite values and also with the dark hearted trio and also against planet Earth.  Those who are enemies of zarakite values in this case are proponents of Earth losing and suffering almighty from a mind controller invasion and other evils en masse, 'nuffs said.  Zarakite values agree.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1615:
     2020-03-01    Common-Era   07:24  EST :  I lack a history of having any bad temper or anger issues, and instead have a history of more than half a decade of being tolerant and lacking getting mad or angry at various things that upset most people.  I learned and taught myself to be open-minded instead, and consider how others might not be at fault and other circumstances may exist, and not get angry at first, and in most cases not get angry at all, and ended up being more tolerant than police officers and at least one professor at Tri-C.  I did this while I was still a student who was still getting plenty of financial aid at the college, and still during the first half of the twelve-and-a-half years I lived at the apartment building.  I was tolerant like this with the people who worked at the apartment building, including the leasing office.  I learned to make it natural and automatic and not require voluntary or deliberate effort, to be open-minded about all sorts of explanations and things that could lead to circumstances that would otherwise be upsetting.  I maintained these skills for greater than five years before and up to Type Five, and lack a pretense for having any anger or temper issues, including what I've been told is by definition 'schizoid' personality characteristics that nearly all mentally ill people have, as explained by doctor Paul Shane, who explained the personality which I and he agreed I do NOT have and never developed and never had a pretense for having.  Examples of being tolerant include waiting for the bus at Tri-C and it being a half-hour late and a professor riding the bus being upset and angry and barking at the driver in anger while refusing to consider what might have happened, while I was calm and actually listened and was open-minded, and understood and believed the driver's story which he told without being asked.  There was a similar situation with the delivery of something I ordered at my apartment and the leasing office, and one of the workers who accepted packages was swamped unfairly and didn't get lunch and had too much work for her and didn't have enough help.  With both of these situations I was self-introspective and thought about what happened, and at times thought about it in my head while working for the campus police which I still did back when I learned these things.  Ever since then I was tolerant, or at least up until Type Five when artificial plastic emotions from thought control were abused and misused on me to the delight and amusement of corrupt Cleveland officials who found it funny and fun to do so.

     2020-03-01    Common-Era   07:48  EST :  I have a pretense, that spans entire whole decades of sustained time both before and after the turn of the century, for eating salt and parmesan cheese and caffiene all in very large amounts that would kill a human being, as a normal and regular thing, and coming up in discussions with mother as well as doctors including psychiatrists, without generating too much alarm as I was allowed and able to freely continue to eat aforementioned large amounts as stated, and this did not result in more or different psychiatric treatment or medications or restrictions, or restrictions or punishments from mother or family, and family would continue to buy food and ingredients in aforementioned large amounts over the years, before and after turning eighteen years old, before and after the turn of the century, and before and after I moved out and got my own apartment.  Also I have a complete lack of heart attacks from such a diet, along with a complete lack of pretense for heart attacks and anything that would lead me to being inpatient at a hospital, for all of those years and decades, with eating like that.  This was and has been and still is normalcy for me and my digestive system and also pretense.  'Nuffs said.

None of that stuff was ever in MD, not even as any experiment.  Guys with a mustasche also don't belong.  Stocky and-or husky guys who sometimes have beards were never in MD and for good reasons, not even as experiments, and are actually repulsive for that sort of thing.  I don't care if they have wallet chains or not, and I don't care how they are dressed.  Long hair, short hair, T-shirt wearing or otherwise, it doesn't matter.  I don't care if they lack chest and body hair.  I'd take my head off, and it wouldn't be a hard decision.  While we're at it, I'd definitely take my head off for any retarded or down's syndrome types, and ejaculate those qualities out of them, and make them into healthy people that wouldn't talk or act that way.  I'd see to it they would never walk or move or act funny again either, arms and hands and legs and the whole thing.  If they were socially inept, I'd ejaculate at least some of that out of them, at least any that is severe.  I don't care if they are okay with that or not.  Irregardless of what they think or claim, they need it and so do the masses.  Other things to remove at least more than half of from all of the populations include - Asperger's syndrome, mental illness, mental retardation of all sorts, autism, social inpet characteristics, lazyness, lie-cheat-and-steal mentalities, drunk-on-power Archie-bunker personalities that have too much power and become corrupt too easily, evils that come with having a lot of power in one's hands, lack of responsibility for having great power in various forms, criminal ghetto con-man personalities, extremely gullible personality characteristics, extreme stupidity, dangerous psychopathy, schizoid personality characteristics, schizo-typical personality characteristics, diabetes, being overweight, blood pressure disorders, blood sugar disorders, fat and triglyceride disorders, any medical condition that can put an archaic in a doctor's office or hospital, arthritis, cancers of all types, missing body parts, blood disorders, allergies, asthma, erectile disorders, prostate disorders, back pain, sprains, pulled muscles, aching joints, aching muscles, common injuries from physical activity and work, broken bones, injured body parts, spitting and saliva disorders, overactive saliva glands, common colds, flu, fever, coughing spells, acne, sunburn [and suntanning with it, whether it is seen as good or bad], birthmarks, moles, warts, pimples, scars, scabs, redness, inflammation, headaches, sore throat, congested nasal passages, hernias, infections, slow metabolisms, too many freckles, bad vision, blindness, deafness, dyslexia, senile dementia, disabilities, street drug addiction, tobacco addiction, addiction to alchohol, addiction to gambling, delusions [like any delusion that the dark queen supposedly is innocent and not a child abuser and supposedly hasn't been criminal in lying to doctors and schoolteachers and people for years and decades and supposedly isn't a dangerous woman who should be in jail, and supposedly isn't mentally ill then claims her younger son who is healthy supposedly has disorders and mental illness she has, and other psychological 'projection' disorder-related stuff.  A hint is how she hates cameras and video and those types of paper trails as many of them don't lie and can't be refuted in many ways, unlike accumulated lies and persuasion in people over years of time which she loves and wants to be the only 'paper trails' exclusively, and any typed documents based upon those lies and what she feeds people, indirectly as well, which is all a set of dangerous signs] -.  Any zarakite would agree with all of this, the same, no matter what face they have or what tribe they come from.  Zarakite values as well.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1618:
     2020-03-01    Common-Era   19:58  EST :  I have tools to video-tape myself and publish the videos on the Internet, and videotape myself flushing psychiatric medications down the toilet for months and nearly a year at a time, and already have.  I have the tools to publish myself talking and typing about stuff and talking in complete sentences and talking unlike anything in the lies the dark queen comes up with about me over the decades.  I could publish and prove my own baseline and how I'm not mentally ill quite easily, and have the videos public so that doctors and lawyers have to acknowledge and compete with and put up with all of it, and cover their own butts by saying I'm not mentally ill and shouldn't be medicated, so they don't look really stupid.  The dark queen the same.  On the other hand, it would be for a lost cause, as I'm in my forties now, with no college degree, no career, and no start to having a life worth living, not as some old guy who ends up in his sixties after a long court case and the dark trio in jail cells and as a near-homeless guy with no more diability and no career or work skills and too old to start.  There's nothing left for me here, not as any life as any human being of any pretend sort or otherwise.  I don't live to be any old guy, I live life to be young.  I don't live life to look 'accomplished' in any type of dress shirt not even without a necktie.  No way.  I enjoy Nintendo and pizza and the idea of being cool in high school instead of socially inept as a teenager, all for a good reason.  I value and cherish and outright worship those things and so does my sex drive and my values and wants and desires, all for good reasons, and even when others disagree, I and zarakite values and my wants and desires value and see as sacred those things anyways.  This is nothing new and has been a long-running rock-solid commitment with consistency solid as stone the whole entire time.  I don't ever want any 'teen job' ever again with any future life I have, but have fun instead.  I'd save work and paychecks for after the real life worth living is over and the daily grind and rat race takes over and it's all being an old guy and memories and nostalgia of old times that are no longer and 'having fun' is a joke.  If you want anyone who enjoys life as an adult and in their working years, or beyond, turn to the dark trio and their values.  They really build themselves up over the years and build retirement accounts and all three would make unhappy fussy 'teenagers' who couldn't wait until their youths are over, as they don't live life to be young and actually have always seemed to hate that type of life, and would HATE to be youthful and adolescent again, if it actually happened.  I on the other hand disagree and am the opposite.  I'm like that, I'm the black sheep of the family.  I refuse to be like them and call myself a 'hold-out' as I hang onto my own ways and my own ideas and my own goals, tooth and nail, and fight to keep them, and not give in to being like them at all.  This is what I meant before and still do now.  F--- any old-man 'life', yikes.  'Nuffs said.  [Oh and by the way any suicidal stuff is Nietzsche and won't do a d--- thing, I've already tried it anyways just for laughs, and videotaped a bit of it, with diet and eating what I did and more, and spoiled meat and mold and lethal caffiene and salt and oils and fats won't do it and aren't going to.  I followed advice and tried it, and it didn't work, so something else has to be done.  Anything with diet or stuff no human would survive is a failure and doesn't work, and this is rock-solid consistent.  The same with suffering and Nietzsche and being screwed over.  No I don't 'pop' with any sudden super-powers or phenomenon if I'm bullied a lot, and I'm not convinced I ever will.  I never believed in that type of thing anyways and think it sounds mentally ill and delusional.  It also sounds evil and sounds like an excuse for others to bully me and deny me what is mine by right.]

Idea #1619:
     2020-03-05    Common-Era   01:50  EST :  I recall when I first got to this nursing home, Wyant, and I was off medications and pretending to take them back then, when one of the staff said to me 'Hi' and then 'You don't belong here...' as in 'You don't belong in a nursing home or in psychiatry...'.  This wasn't anything new, I'm used to nurses and psychologists and medical workers who work in places exposed to psychiatry to tell me things like that and talk to me like that, friendly, matter-of-factly, and in-between.  I've had that plenty of times over the years and also from private psychiatrists, including Doctor Alamir and Doctor Zuchowski in various ways.  Doctor Zuchowski I remember wanted, in her professional medical opinion as a doctor, to take me off all psychiatric medications and have me stay that way, and thought that was what should be done or at least tried.  She wanted a mood stabilizer medication considered to tame withdraw symptoms as the psychiatric medications were reduced and tapered off then discontinued.  Anyways there is pretense and normalcy for doctors and nurses and medical workers and staff to be this way about me before and after Type Five I've noticed, as well as before and after the turn of the century, and before and after I turned eighteen years old.  That normalcy is there for good and logical reasons.  Mother lied.  She found she could get away with it, that doctors would always take her word for it and she would never be cross-examined, and she would never have to provide evidence or proof, and she didn't have to explain details or even examples in many cases, often generalizations would do the trick.  Doctors would smile and nod their heads and eat up her lies over the years.  She found that she could do this and always get away with it and it would always work.  I found that I witnessed that it would always work and doctors would always take it.  Part of what might have helped her get away with it is how she used to be a registered nurse before I was born and she would establish that and make doctors ask her 'Are you a doctor?' during appointments and this gave her instant credibility and clout.  It always worked.  It always covered up her mean-spirited spiteful nature and how she never loved me and always hated me.  I got her to admit this once but it was difficult and since then she would playact and put on a very cheesy very unconvincing deliberately fake smile and tone of voice and say things like 'Oh but of course I love you' in case she was being recorded or witnessed.  She would do this on the phone escpecially.  She's been very careful over the years, not wanting the slightest slip-up.  When I had the very first guides during Type Five, I wondered, if only I could get her to take a polygraph or lie-detector test, and videotape it, and have it professionally done for a court.....  The concepts of 'truth-tell' and 'truth-talk' come from this.  She is no video-game character, and is very intelligent and lacks gullibility, and is a very calculating complex women and thinker, and she is very dangerous and very heartless and cold and psychopathic and dleiberately unloving, and very deliberately hates me, and this is nothing new.  Salt knows I'm honest and doesn't need me to eat anything for this one.  Salt will have me eat something anyways at some point.  'Salt' by the way refers to witchcraft and magical ritual, serious-minded, and not 'crazy-talk'.  I work with Tarot cards, and photographed and videotaped it, remember?  Photos are on Linkedin as well as Sourceforge and in Youtube videos countless times, put up on the wall, and I still have the cloth spread for the cards in my backpack which I still have.  Yes, the black cloth with the pentagram and other symbols on it, and I take these things seriously.  No, no devil is involved.  I'm not Catholic and I don't use any Christian Bible for my religion, I use what's called a 'Book Of Shadows' which is another term for a witch's or warlock's bible of magic, subject to Freedom Of Religion in the USA, and I published on SourceForge some photos and diagrams I created for mine.  Those aren't a video game.  I did those spreads downstairs in this nursing home, and the ones photographed and on Linkin and hopefully Facebook I did in the old apartment I used to have.  I was also in to this stuff long before Type Five and recall my birthday 'wish' if you call it that when my older brother had his apartment in Monroe Falls Ohio which he got after he moved out after high school.  That involved Wicca and witchcraft, serious-minded, thank you.  As far as Christianity is concerned, I respect that religion and church as someone who is not a part of it.  I'm not anti-Catholic, I'm simply non-Catholic.  The two are not the same.  I decided that a long time ago, many years, and since then have kept it consistent.  I also promised to save the Catholic church without being any part of it, if mind controllers and the dark trio's powers are at all real, even though I was warned it would be against the grain.  Also, the ritual witch's bottle with aluminum foil and a Tarot card spread and listening to music and marking the outside with a blue ink Sharpie permanant marker, that was witchcraft, and that was with a Tarot spread done on aluminum treadplate found in hardware stores, as I like ritual and magic with style, man!  Some of that I photographed.  'Nuffs said.

     2020-03-05    Common-Era   01:50  EST :  I hate it when everyone around me is smarter than I am.  I also hate it when everyone around me knows more than I do.  'Nuffs said.


Idea #1621:
     2020-03-05    Common-Era   20:15  EST :  I never saw myself as a 'cute-and-cuddly' type of guy that would ever 'snuggle' up against anyone, of any kind.  No way.  I am okay with skin against skin in certain situations but as for the idea of being someone's walking little-girl-fairy-tale-land muppet blanket that would ever 'snuggle' or be cute or affectionate in that type of way, NO, NEVER EVER.  NO WAY.  On the other hand I'm not a guy for wearing a cowboy hat and needing a shave, or anyone who drinks or uses tobacco either.  Nope.  I'm not anything related to stoners or drug users either.  You can also leave out Asperger's Syndrome type of stuff, which I HATE and find vile and repulsive and EVIL, massive and beyond belief, and don't want anywhere near me, EVER.  NO WAY would I ever enjoy or like any Asperger's Syndrome crap, not with years of Chinese Water Torture, not with any brainwashing, never.  The same with all of this is true before and also long before Type Five, and before and after life in North Olmsted, and these truths are normalcy and natural, thank you.  For Tiger's Eye's personality, the same applies, all the way.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1622:
     2020-03-06    Common-Era   18:32  EST :  The Dark Queen is a big spender.  If money is placed in her hands she tends to spend all of it.  If it is an excessive amount of money this is also the case.  She also claims to her younger son during times she has a lot of money to spend that she's supposedly poor and without funds.  Her spending habits are demonstrated in a number of her emails.  It shows.  She spends on lavish luxieries for herself and I've never seen or heard of her saving money long-term, ever.

Idea #1623:
     2020-03-06    Common-Era   18:32  EST :  The Dark Queen, at one point after I moved out and got my apartment, changed the locks on her doors and sent an email to the rest of the family except me that she was 'scared' and she did this when counseling sessions started and evidence of her being an abusive parent surfaced, along with signs that she lied over the years and I was never psychiatric.  She did this as a pretending and drama act, to make me look dangerous and make me look like I would do something like break into her house.  She and the doctor doing the counseling both knew I was never the law-breaking type, and I would never break into her house like that, and I never developed or had that sort of ghetto criminal lifestyle or mindset at any point over the years and decades, life-long.  She sent the email to the Dark Hearted King.  By the way, her emails I aquired without breaking any laws and without violating her rights.  I fixed her computer at one point that was infected via a virus, and backed up her files, and cleaned her files of virus infections, including emails, to restore them so she would have them.  I told her I had a backup of her files including her emails that I cleaned and asked her if she wanted them back or wanted them destroyed, after giving her one copy of all of that.  I asked her several times, and not on the same day or the same week.  Each time she said 'no' and didn't want me to throw them out or hand them over.  I asked on the phone and I think I also asked face-to-face.  She knew I had them and knew how I got them, and knew about the virus and how I disinfected her email files.  I did not steal her emails or break any laws in getting or having them and she knew that and the fact I still had them over years of time came up in converstaions where I brought it up for her benefit and she was not accusing me and no one else was accusing me of wrongdoing either.  Anyways, she never told me about the email about changing her locks, or what she did with the locks, or supposedly why she was playing the victim and doing things she said in her email.  She probably did actually change the locks as she can't live with the idea of being caught red-handed lying and being deceptive.  She's like that.  If she's caught she panics and cracks, like with Doctor Chapman the counselor, and she gets violent and unpredictable and rants and sobs and gets weird and hyperactive, in exagerrated distress, and doesn't calm down, and makes drastic permanant decisions that are dangerous and not thought out with any calm or clear-thinking mind.  She is very intelligent and really has a mind for psychological mind games and is happy and content when she's lying and getting away with deceptions long-term and has everyone fooled.

Idea #1624:
     2020-03-09    Common-Era   07:25  EST :  SPY GAMES I was told have been ordered to be shut down and declared too dangerous to start again, and ordered not to start again, by the CIA and other USA officials.  Personally I don't know what all of that means but I'm guessing it's a good thing.  I didn't start any of the Spy Games and don't know who did or what they are really but they are now stopped.  I asked in the past what a 'spy game' is and got multiple answers that lacked consistency, totally different answers that didn't sound like anything to do with each other, and were very confusing and misleading.  Other times I got no answers.  No one told me I wasn't allowed to know, and no one said anything like 'I can't comment on that, I'm not authorized' and no one told me that I shouldn't ask or anything like that.  I don't know if the term will come up again ever with any training with zarakites and swordfighting and practice to fight hostile exosolars or not.  I don't know if it is in manuals and textbooks or not.  A quick search on the Internet with my computer comes up with a 1999 film and a 2001 film, movie titles, and not any term with any definition.  That's all I could find that's substantial in Internet search results, nothing more, nothing less.  I DO know that the SPY GAMES had something to do with things going in and out of the heads of nearby people around me as well as myself and involves telepathy.  This altogether makes sense and altogether simply makes sense.

Idea #1625:
     2020-03-20    Common-Era   09:42  EST :  I've established and documented and published my own baseline for what I'm like when not on medications for anything at all.  It's been videotaped, how I'm like several months in a row at least, what I'm like and how I walk and talk and eat and have conversations with people, and the videotapings have been uploaded and published for all the world to see on Youtube and Sourceforge.  I did these things up until about a couple of months ago.  Also I was not taking medications of any kind for anything during Type Five and fine just the same, and even driving my Toyota Corolla car I had back then, just fine, for months in a row, as well as driving out to restaurants and eating out, and during many of those days except for withdrawl symptoms I was just fine and actually doing very well and really feeling alive and awake and actually "with it" instead of feeling half-awake and unaware all the time which the medications would do.  I didn't have any close calls with my car, and was actually handed a job application which I was filling out to get a new job and get hired.  I wasn't shown to the door for being a walking wreck instead, not at all.  Now there is a PUBLIC frame of reference which is published for these things, for all the world to see and watch and download, and anyone who claims I would have certain problems without medications HAS TO contest and refute and talk about what was videotaped and uploaded as powerful evidence and a baseline of it's own that speaks for itself.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1626:
     2020-03-20    Common-Era   11:08  EST :  None of the dark hearted trio can tolerate ingesting anywhere near as much caffiene as me.  None of the dark hearted trio have TK or telekinesis of any kind.  None of the dark hearted trio can eat as much salt at once as I can.  None of the dark hearted trio can listen to music so loud it damages their eardrums, and then have their hearing come back just as good as is was.  None of the dark hearted trio can eat spoiled food that is clearly toxic, not just meat but meat AND other stuff as well, and lack health issues from doing so.  None of the dark hearted trio can songwrite or sing or potentially play musical instruments very well.  None of the dark hearted trio like teenage youth or live life for being a teenager or adolescent or any of the fun and pleasures that comes at those years of age and for people of those years of age.  Proto and probably Tiger's Eye Jade SwiftWing have all of these things that the dark hearted trio do not.

Idea #1627:
     2020-03-21    Common-Era   15:49  EST :  Type Five was caused by the traumatic pain I felt because of the actions of the evil Reeves family and how they bullied and hated me for so long as an unwanted child and 'black sheep' of the family, and the cruel and inhumane hardships they put me through, and how these evils and hardships were covered up in secrecy and veiled in lies and pretending for too many years as the family did so many pretending acts to make themselves look like they loved me but were in fact otherwise the whole time.  They didn't care how cruel they got, or how many laws or ethics they broke, or how 'below the belt' they were at any time.  They didn't let being inhumane or extremely cruel stop them.  These things I know for a fact are both honest and true, rock solid, and cannot be otherwise, with certainty that is stronger than the hardest thickest stone of all time.  Them getting away with it for so long has also been a big part of that pain and suffering.  I never asked for or wanted any pain or suffering of that magnitude, or to be bullied like that, at all, ever, 'nuffs said.  After what I've been through, how could it not be cruel and inhumane and really below-the-belt for others to bully me and mess with me?  How heartless.  Being that cruel draws attention and does something to one's reputation, and not just personal, and certainly makes heads turn in shock and horror and disgust.  Well, it should.  Of course it would, why not?  No wonder there have been operators I was stuck with that literally embraced having psychopathy and being cold and heartless, behind the scenes.  No one else could be assinged to me and live with themselves and see to it that I'm bullied or discredited so badly, as well as put through a bunch of other hardships.  This stuff had to come out at some point.

     2020-04-01    Common-Era   01:19  EST :  The dark hearted prince tried illegal street drugs while he was a university student after he was done with high school.  He tried the stuff and as far as I know he never got arrested or charged for any of it.  He did however have to drop out of college then go back because of psych issues.  He also has a learning disability.  His mother bailed him out of psychiatry and didn't let his diagnosis stick, and didn't want him to be a life-long psychiactric patient.

Idea #1634:
     2020-04-01    Common-Era   01:19  EST :  I am an unwanted child.  My evil and sick-minded mean excuse for 'parents' did NOT give me and my older brother equal treatment over the years and decades, at all, ever.  To me they broke laws and were inhumane, and shameless about it.  They continued to be this way over the years and made it a habit and made themselves used to it, to the point where now it won't ever seem like anything wrong to them to mistreat and hate and hurt me like they do.  They reached that point, all three of them, years ago.  They are the dark hearted trio and they have passed a point of no return a long time ago, and lost the ability to properly feel shame and guilt a long time ago.  For many years all three of them don't react like any human being does when they are at fault for something, or even wrong about something, whether trivial or severe.  They lack the ability to have the mental thought process.  Anyone who studies any one of the three of them for a while can figure that out quite easily, I'm sure.  They deserve pain and suffering comparable to what they have put me through.  They are also dangerous to people outside of the family.  Diane Minnery saw what was going on and how dangerous they were to her family, or at least how dangerous the dark queen is, and broke away and refused to be involved with the family after that.  She had to put up with the dark queen discrediting her and accusing her of supposedly joining and being brainwashed by some religious cult.  Diane Minnery's reputation suffered and so did she.  Ruth Fielder and her family also suffered, and Ruth Fielder was misled like a mouse to poisoned cheese with bad advice on who to trust and who to go to during one family crisis after another, with the dark queen smiling and sneaky and scheming while 'putting on a face' on at least one telephone call, as I witnessed.  The dark queen and actually the whole dark trio have made permanant changes to human beings and their lives and their brain cells and thinking and what they are able and allowed to think, left and right, for years and decades, and I would think that more would notice and be alarmed by it, and the fact that they still do this with impunity and are even worse but careful and secretive and sneaky with a lot of stealth about it is outrageous.  They are all very intelligent, too intelligent, and have fooled many gods and spirits and have too much karma they didn't earn but stole and lied and cheated to have, for too many years now, one could say, if they knew.

Idea #1642:
     2020-04-22    Common-Era   04:07  EST :  The dark hearted prince thinks that if someone has a disability and-or weakness, that the weakness is the fault of the individual who has it, and that individual is to be blamed for having it.  The dark hearted prince has proven, over the years and decades, that he thinks like this, with his attitude and things he says and does and how he has mistreated and bullied and badmouthed Proto at times.  This, by logic and also according to zarakite values, makes the dark hearted prince both closed-minded and also evil, 'nuffs said.  The dark hearted queen has also demonstrated the same evil personality traits, and has also mistreated and bullied and badmouthed Proto in the same ways.  She is evil in the same ways.  As far as the dark hearted king goes, he has had no sympathy for Proto and might be just as evil the-same/in-the-same-ways-as-well.  A crippled person who lives much of their time in a wheelchair attempting to explain to the dark hearted prince or queen that it isn't their fault they have to use a wheelchair doesn't get any understanding or sympathy, but only pretend faked sympathy via playacting at best.  In my case medications I've been on involuntarily make me fat, and it isn't my fault, and I don't want to be fat or overweight but can't change what the medications do, but trying to explain this and the basic common sense logic behind it to either the dark hearted prince or the dark hearted queen in some hypothetical situation and making one or both of them understand wouldn't work because of how closed-minded and spiteful and evil they and their personalities are.  Instead they would blame me for being fat and see me as being at fault for it, and take it further and also blame me for needing the medications as well.  Needless to say, their closed-minded natures obviously make them illogical, and these concepts are one example of such.

Idea #1643:
     2020-04-22    Common-Era   16:59  EST :  The dark hearted queen was always angry at me instead of feeling sorry or caring or sympathetic whenever I would get injured or hurt and have any visible signs of injury or being hurt, when I was little and also throughout the years of what was not a normal childhood.  She would be angry at me and say things like 'hide that [bleeding injury] before someone sees it and accuses me of being an abusive parent' and so on.  She would only care about herself and how she would look.  She kept doing this countless times over the years whenever accidents happened.  There was never any love, any of those occasions.

Idea #1644:
     2020-04-22    Common-Era   16:59  EST :  Over the years and decades whenever something frustrated me and would upset me, this always made the dark queen hold back a smile.  She always enjoyed it and would hold it back and hide it, but not convincingly.  I know she did these things and I remember too many times how true it is.  I know there were many times it happened and lack specific examples to describe.  On the other hand I believe in not only 'father I cannot tell a lie I chopped down the tree' but I also believe in telling all to a courtroom judge including the good and bad and everything in-between including what incriminates me as long as all of it is honest, true, and real the same.  I would think that telling my story like that would establish frames of reference for honesty and telling it like it is and credibility when I point out what the dark trio are like.

Idea #1645:
     2020-04-22    Common-Era   16:59  EST :  Over the years and decades the dark trio and the dark hearted queen herself especially have been secretive and worried about how they look when certain things are exposed.  They hate evidence and paper trails that tell any stories that say anything about themselves or myself.

Idea #1646:
     2020-04-22    Common-Era   16:59  EST :  The dark hearted queen was always very upset and weird and pretending to be okay with my job I got with the campus police at the college I went to.  She would ask if I told any of the cops about myself or my family.  At one point she was very angry and upset about that type of idea and yelled at me and threatened me for if I ever did talk to any police officer or mental health professional [psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, etc] about my life and my story.  She was very mad I mentioned my story and her abusive nature, to Doctor Paul Shane at the college.  I tried to explain it to my sergeant at one point but didn't have any way of explaining the whole story in a few short sentences and he was already busy at the time and didn't have time for a serious talk.  He made a wild and uneducated guess and called things 'separation anxiety' but didn't seem to really understand what was going on.  I managed to tell about half the story to Doctor Robert Chapman who concluded that I should get a lawyer and that there were some very serious things going on that worried him.  He did this after conducting emergency family counseling sessions instead of the usual therapy for me, for a few sessions.  The dark hearted queen lied right in front of Liz Couz the social worker from ViaQuest and claimed that there were no such counseling sessions and also claimed that I never had any Doctor Chapman for a doctor.  The sessions actually DID show up on TriCare EOB forms that are part of a paper trail and history with Champus Tricare-For-Life military health insurance that I had because of the dark hearted king being in the military.  The dark hearted queen later changed her tune about whether or not Doctor Chapman and his counseling and therapy sessions ever existed, but that was after Liz Couz was not a part of the picture anymore.  Liz Couz became a fast quick friend of the dark hearted queen who was quickly victimized by her influence and sympathetic to her and believed her lies without question.  Liz Couz was also hostile and aggressive and menacing to me at times the more she personally bonded with the dark hearted queen.

Idea #1647:
     2020-04-24    Common-Era   10:30  EST :  When I voluntarily try to remember something, or stop and try to recall something, I imagine what I'm trying to remember.  This is normal for me and part of how I think.  It always has been.

Idea #1648:
     2020-04-24    Common-Era   10:30  EST :  If I'm going to ask someone about something that person did in the past, I typically [maybe always] first imagine in my head what that something they did is [and sometimes imagine them doing it as I remember them doing it in the past], and then say something about what they did.  This is normal for me and part of how I think.  It always has been.

Idea #1649:
     2020-04-24    Common-Era   10:30  EST :  I imagine to daydream the same way I imagine to remember which is the same way I think in general.  I can imagine forcefully with a lot of mental push/effort, and imagine gently which takes voluntary effort to hold back how hard the thinking is [which takes a lot of work and voluntary mental effort holding it back] to create and allow low-pressure thoughts, and I can relax and think casually which has a mental forcefulness in-between the two strengths and is very easy for me to think.  The range of forcefullness varies as 'floating point' [on a gradient, if measured and put on a chart each value would have many digits as decimal numbers smaller than 1.0 and none would be an exact integer] and is never a consistent even level and can't ever be even and straight even if I wanted it to be like that.  All of this is normal for me and part of how I think.  It always has been.  Note that regarding terminology, I'm not a math major.  I'm also not any sort of brain surgeon or medical major or psychology major, at all, and never was.

Idea #1650:
     2020-04-24    Common-Era   10:30  EST :  I can imagine while doing things with my hands and feet, with physical action and imagination in sync with each other.  As a musician I'm actually used to this.  I can walk and chew gum both at the same time easily, so to speak.  This is normal for me and part of how I think.  It always has been.

Idea #1651:
     2020-04-24    Common-Era   10:30  EST :  I can imagine more then one sound at a time.  When imagining music I can imagine more than one instrument at the same time, and I can imagine chords.  This type of thing takes voluntary mental effort of course, and is more difficult than imagining only one instrument or track at a time.  When I write songs I use creativity to come up with a tune by imagining a track or melody that isn't already a song, and then I play it on my guitar or track it on my computer.  Sometimes I start with an existing tune and then creatively change it and make a new tune in my head with imagination and then have a starting point to writing a song.  I've heard lots of musicians do this.  Other times I come up with something completely original and then get a track or two recorded on my computer with one of my guitars and some synths [typically for drums].  This is normal for me and part of how I think.  It has been as far back as I can remember.

Idea #1652:
     2020-04-24    Common-Era   11:26  EST :  For me, daydreaming [via imagining] and planning something mentally, are the exact same type of thinking.  Usually it is done in my head.  It is easiest to do when alert and very awake.  Sometimes daydreaming turns into planning something.  Sometimes planning something turns into daydreaming if I get sidetracked too much.  I can go back and forth at times and do both at the same time.  For me there is no clear line between the two.  Getting sidetracked a little by getting creative ideas and the beginning sparks of something all the time whenever thinking about anything happens all the time for me, life-long, and is something I'm used to, and is something I'm used to being able to handle and work with, and make work for me.  I'm a creative guy.  Rigid thinking like a robot is unheard of for me and is too artificial and unnatural for me to come close to doing, and I've always been this way regardless of changes and major life things over the years and regardless of the last several years.  I'm also an open-minded thinker by nature who considers many things and tends to think deeply and consider something carefully if there's nothing better to do at the moment.  I also daydream when bored, such as waiting for something, if I'm not in a conversation with someone to pass time instead.  All of this is normal for me and part of how I think.  It has been as far back as I can remember.

Idea #1653:
     2020-04-24    Common-Era   11:26  EST :  When I was little I learned to read by mentally pronouncing each word that I was reading off of a piece of paper.  I was taught to either read it outloud [for a classroom usually] or in my head.  Doing both at the same time is something I can't do, my brain just won't do it but will do one or the other, although I can switch back and forth easily while reading.  When mentally pronouncing every word I never move my lips or change my breathing.  I never developed that habit.  I can also read while not mentally or physically pronouncing anything at all, with only silence in my head, and although I don't have as much experience reading this way I don't find it difficult and I also find it makes me read things faster.  This faster method is not something I ever did during any years of school, however.  All of this is normal for me and part of how I think.  It has been as far back as I can remember.

Idea #1654:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   06:50  EST :  When I was about to open this file to type this Idea I was suddendly stimulated, in a way which was not at all natural, to be lazy and do something other than write out an Idea before returning to the computer video game I was playing, and have the un-natural intention of writing this Idea at some later time, but most likely forget to write the Idea.  I pushed myself to overcome this un-natural stimulation and type this Idea.  I was stimulated to instead download another computer video game that I can download later.  'Computer video game' had a positive and pseudo-familiar feeling to it just now irregardless of something of one of the dark trio that happened to come with it.  'There is something that is rough and in the red' just came to mind, along with panting for breath.  Anyways, I've been playing the computer video game 'Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut' for a while now, modded by myself quite a bit regardless of how the game is difficult to mod.  I've changed gameplay to my liking quite a bit, and combine it with some make-believe to bring back some ideas of it being closer to realistic.  Some of the make-believe stuff includes ideas of zarakites and the characters having soft-headed parts including the heads, and sometimes some of the weapons being playground weapons, and sometimes some of the areas and places being playgrounds like what draco would play in, and some of the game's weapons being hi-tech stuff with futuristic technology moreso than what's already in the game to begin with.  Jenson is a guy I still imagine as a human, a cyborg.  At times I imagine that some of the characters don't die but instead harmlessly have their heads defeated like a draco or sky child, from the weapons.  As a result it's still an unrealistic game, but as close and as far from being realistic as it was before I modded it.  Some of this gives me more Ideas about zarakites and how they will live and such.  I've also picked a hotel room in the game at one point and pretended I rented the room, and left things there, noticing the game lets me do that.  I did it with one of the empty hotel rooms in the Chinese island's hotel in the game.  In part of another playthrough I did it with the back area and through the door which leads to sewers, right around from the merchant, in the game.  Sometimes I don't upgrade some of the weapons all the way in the game, for imagined realism and ideas, it varies.  I've also come up with ideas for how Adam Jenson, one of the game's characters, can carry so much in his personal inventory.
	In the past I've come up with Ideas about the ethics of what one of the game's characters, 'Tindall', was doing in the game.  My judgement is that he was doing wrong, and his actions of giving away some things didn't excuse that.  He would steal from the corporation 'Sarif Industries' and give away what he stole, and while his acts of charity were good, he got the stuff by doing wrong.  He could have bought it with his own money, his paycheck, and given it away, which would make him good instead of evil, but he didn't do that.  Yes people in the game needed what he stole and gave away like how people need clothing, and giving it away to people who couldn't afford it was like donating clothing to the poor, but stealing it in the first place was like stealing clothing from department stores to give it away later.  That's how I came up with my judgement for what he was doing, and why I judged him as a criminal, evil and bad.  In my book Jenson doesn't do much better in the game.  Jenson should involve his boss and the police and corporate lawyers, and prosecution of Carella should have happened, him and Tindall.  The game forces the player into having Jenson do things he shouldn't, no matter how it plays out, in my opinion.  Jenson does wrong by acting in corruption and backing up Carella as a close buddy who would hide a dead body for him.  When he does that he covers up Carella's criminal theft and betrays his boss and Sarif Industries, and Jenson also makes himself a criminal with the way the plotline in the game plays out, no matter what the choices made are.  The closest to Jenson doing the right thing is him not accepting the sidequest at all, although refusing to report Carella and how Carella continues to offer the sidequest to start because Jenson allows him to do that is still corruption on Jenson's part.  That's how I see it.  Jenson is the corporate chief of security for Sarif Industries in the game, and is in charge of all of the company's security, and preventing theft and crime and corruption, as well as security issues, and shouldn't be corrupt for the business to avoid going out of business, yikes.  Carella should have simply been turing himself in and confessing when he went to Jenson's office, allowing Jenson to fire and prosecute Carella, not start a sidequest.  That's how I see it.  On the other hand I didn't make the game to begin with, and there are plenty of reasons I play it.  I don't like how Jenson is corrupt and criminal in so many ways in the original un-modded game, though, and how there are not options for Jenson to be better, looking at what choices the player is allowed for how Jenson behaves.  Also, what's up with Jenson getting a 'successful' completion of part of a sidequest by accepting a bribe from O'Malley in another sidequest, allowing O'Malley to go free and kill and murder more people?  Jenson himself says of O'Malley 'Can't let a guy like that roam free' and also in one set of choices talks about how O'Malley does dirty criminal things on a regular basis as habit.  Why is it that if Jenson refuses the bribe and gets O'Malley arrested instead of going free that the mission objective is listed as 'failed' for not being bribed like that?  Yikes, what's up with the video game developers who came up with that?  WTF?  Also, Jenson didn't work for the police anymore, so what business does he have getting involved with O'Malley and that sidequest to begin with?  In real life, none, not unless he wants to be a criminal vigilante and accept a corrupt undercover's offer to be such, especially with how the plotline plays out if Jenson accepts the sidequest.  Also, Jenson got hired as the boss of corporate security for Sarif Industries, and had someone else he DOES work for in the game, which means even more that he has no business taking the sidequest or involving himself like that with a police department he didn't work at anymore [and got fired from, BTW].  And why should a civilian be the one who arrests O'Malley?  Why should that even be an option?  Even a disreputable real-life police department saturated with corruption wouldn't do such a thing, I'd think.  If they did I don't see how they would get away with it.  That and the bad guy's legal defense could argue in court he was illegally investigated and illegally 'arrested' and really get a break, while the police department would sure have people sacked and really cleaned out, with supervisors and cops having their butts put in slings over it.  Too many heads would roll for that.
	This seems to be a recurring thing in the Deus Ex games since Human Revolution, bad guys getting away with it, and justice coming only sometimes, and when it does it isn't usually until after too late.  If I were Jenson I'd certainly say the famous line 'I didn't ask for this' and be a target having to fight off bad guys only because I would be too much of a good guy who refuses to be criminal or corrupt, and is hated because of that, and therefore a target by so many.  Good thing Jenson, as a cyborg, is designed to work and fight alone, and can handle the world against himself, and also potentially save it, if anyone can.  Kinda funny how the world is against you if you want to save it.
	'Nuffs said.

Idea #1655:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   08:43  EST :  Been playing more Deus Ex HR.  Just now [within the last several minutes], Jenson selling his maxed-out assault gun rifle in the game's Detroit before Camp FEMA brought on a weak but good feeling, artificial/plastic/fake/generated as it was.  'Rifle' in 'assault rifle' had a somewhat fiery/blistering/rough feel to it, and didn't fit with 'assault' at all, but 'gun' fit good.  The 'rough' feeling was to suggest that it was the wrong word for the term.  Someone knows what all this means and what to do with all of it, and needs this data.  All of this altogether makes sense and simply makes sense.

Idea #1656:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   08:48  EST :  I noticed in a previous playthrough of Deus Ex HR before my current one that Jack O'Malley has unpleasantly/unattractively washed-out/diluted/dull aqua-grey-colored/blue-green-grey-colored eyes.  They do not glow or give off any light, and their pupils are black but look white and grey from reflections and specularity and the lighting in the game.  Jack O'Malley is by reputation a dishonest man in the game but off the top of my head I can't think of any specific example in the game where he lies/is-dishonest.  All of this is how I see it and my opinion and perspective.  All of this altogether makes sense and simply makes sense.

Idea #1657:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   08:58  EST :  I still use the word 'plastic' as a slang term for 'artificial', as well as 'fabricated' and opposite of 'natural'.  I also use an apostrophe followed by 'sup' as short for 'what's up?'.  These things also apply to Zarakite American English, as I can see it.  All of this altogether makes sense and simply makes sense.

Idea #1658:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   10:18  EST :  Silence can be used to communicate.  Silence sometimes communicates something involuntarily, and silence sometimes communicates something unknowingly.  Irregardless, silence is a valid response to other communication.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1660:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   10:31  EST :  At least two out of three of the dark hearted trio like the idea of being psychic, and are into that sort of thing.  They also love mind games and deceptions and manipulating others.  It fits with dark hearted trio values, it fits with their values and ideals.  They would love to go around having an ability like a 'Jedi Mind Trick' that they could use on others all the time.  Such things are among what they would do if they could have superpowers over others.  Such things are really their kind of thing and among their likes and ideals.  Such things and such deceptions and manipulations are all against zarakite values, and evil according to zarakite values, and powers that zarakites would never have.  'Nuffs said.  This still simply makes sense.

Idea #1661:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   10:56  EST :  This has come up in many conversations to the point of falling on deaf ears at times, but spirits need to speak by themselves and for themselves, saying their own things that they choose to say, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1662:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   11:02  EST :  This has come up in many conversations to the point of falling on deaf ears at times, but spirits should/ought-to speak by themselves and for themselves, saying their own things that they choose to say, 'nuffs said.  They have already proven that this is within their means, quite frequently and strongly as such when they do, sometimes, at least.  There was a brief hint/flash of a dream I had within the last several years, just now.  I had that same dream more than once, I think.  This still simply makes sense, and still did to begin with.

This has been true countless times in the past and still is, and applies to all zarakites, and today still simply makes sense.

Idea #1664:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   11:13  EST :  Shaved heads, bald heads, and heads with scalp hair cut so short it meets requirements to work in human USA military, are unattractive and ugly to the zarakite sex drive.  What makes such heads look even more repulsive to any zarakite is an oversize nose and-or ears that stick out, combined with scalp hair cut so short or shaved.  Exceptions are the fanhawk mohawk hair style, a version of the spike-top hair style, and an uppercut hair style, as already established.  'nuff said.  This has been true countless times in the past and still is, and applies to all zarakites, and today still simply makes sense.

Such respect is good and valued in zarakite values, 'nuffs said.  This has been true countless times in the past and still is, and applies to all zarakites, and today still simply makes sense.

Idea #1673:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   11:34  EST :  Racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination, are all generally and by default EVIL and BAD in zarakite values, 'nuffs said.  The zarakite sex drive and therefore all zarakites do however discriminate, and as such the least evil thing is to be honest about this.  Self control by being nice/polite to those who are ugly/repulsive is good according to zarakite values, 'nuffs said.  This type of self control has limits of course but is still something all zarakites are capable of, which itself is a good thing as zarakite values see-it/judge.  This has been true countless times in the past and still is, and applies to all zarakites, and today still simply makes sense.

This applies to bodies with a torso that has washboard abs, little to no abdominal muscles and skinny, and skinny with a slight bit of belly fat.  Looking emaciated or malnourished however is freakish and repulsive instead.  This of course invariably applies to all zarakites.  This has been true countless times in the past and still is, and applies to all zarakites, and today still simply makes sense.

This applies to hair that has aforementioned qualities naturally, without any cosmetics or beauty products being used.  Scalp hair that is any combination of - thin, damaged, sparse, grey or white from age, unhealthy, oily/greasy, wavy, curly - is ugly and repulsive to the eyes of all zarakites and also to the zarakite sex drive.  This of course invariably applies to all zarakites.  This has been true countless times in the past and still is, and applies to all zarakites, and today still simply makes sense.

Zarakites would not have sex like that in prison.  'Nuffs said.  This of course invariably applies to all zarakites.  This has been true countless times in the past and still is, and applies to all zarakites, and today still simply makes sense.

     2020-05-02    Common-Era   10:35  EST :  The idea of leaving the roof door open while running downstairs before coming back up again, which was within the last several minutes, had a good and attractive feeling to it, and so did the imagery which I liked.  Also, it had logic to it which I liked, and it seemed like something I would try in that type of situation.  I regret I didn't do it.  Also, what I did right after coming back up was maybe late, I'm not sure if I regret or not doing that before heading downstairs to that guy or not.  Regarding the visual renders and the feelings with it, I would like to experience those and that type of stuff again.  Someone[s] knows what to do with this data and said they could use it.  Okay, I'll go back to the game now, and try to get rid of the washed-out gamma to the video/visual stuff, and I hate a washed-out look from too much gamma, but I also hate it when all of it is too dark.
