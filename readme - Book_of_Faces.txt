Personality References
The following films, published for the public, USA (United States of America) are used for reference regarding one or more
of the personalities of the chosen:
‘Stepfather II’, 1989, Incorporated Television Company (ITC)
‘The Neverending Story II’, 1990, Warner Bros.
‘Ladybugs’, 1992, Paramount Pictures
Trivia: During the beginning of the film, Jonathan Brandis' character Matthew calls Rodney Dangerfield's character Chester,
"Chesterfield." Jonathan had a habit in real-life of referring to certain friends in jest by adding "field" to the end of their
names. It is rumored by some who knew him that he carried this over into the film and ad-libbed "Chesterfield" as an inside
joke.
‘Sidekicks’, 1992, Gallery Films, Vision PDG
Trivia: Jonathan Brandis's role in the film is almost similar to a role he had auditioned for, before his death in 2003. Brandis
would audition for the role of Anakin Skywalker in "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones", but lost out to Hayden
Christensen. Barry (Brandis) is instructed martial arts by Mr. Lee (Mako).
‘Man of the House’, 1995, Walt Disney
‘Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children’, 2005, Square Enix Company, Square USA
‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze’, 1991, Golden Harvest Company
‘The Beverly Hillbillies’, 1993, Twentieth Century Fox

Jade

‘Jade’, Face is derived from chosen 000 Akira Suzuki, age 16 and under, male, non-Negro, heterosexual, nonpsychic, human, always non-infected and non-infectious, Japanese Celebrity musician from the Japanese rock band
‘Gazette’ which is also known-as/listed-as in some Internet references and such as ‘The Gazette’, the bass guitar player for
the band, he was born May 27 1981 in Sagamihara, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, Blood Type A which should be compatible
with Proto’s blood type which is type O negative, if Proto remembers right, if mutations have to get weird and unexpected,
it is remembered that Zare owes this guy a lot and made promises to him to at least try to make happen, even after a bunch
of personal stuff… Public ‘stage personality’ profile lists a liking of Kit-Kat candy which coincidentally Proto likes, and
how this face used to smoke cigarettes, which coincidentally Proto doesn’t like and never got into but doesn’t mind if it is
blown in his face, thanks to Steve and one of the guys Proto worked with who proved it.

Prismatic

‘Prismatic’, Face is derived from chosen 001 Joseph Amato, age 16 and under, male, non-Negro, heterosexual,
non-psychic, human, always non-infected and non-infectious. Mr. Amato went to the same junior high school as Proto,
went to the same high school as Proto, and was in the same grade as Proto and some of the same classes (at least physicaleducation/gym-class) as Proto during such. Mr. Amato was in the same grades at the same time as Proto in junior high
school, which was North Olmsted Middle School in North Olmsted Ohio USA. Mr. Amato also went to the same high
school as Proto, North Olmsted High School located in the same City Of North Olmsted located in Cuyahoga County in
Ohio in the nation USA (United States Of America). Mr. Amato had a nifty-looking/attractive ‘spike-top’ haircut Proto
thinks he remembers from junior high school years which Proto thinks and thought looked really looked good on Mr.
Amato, and Proto thought Mr. Amato’s hair was black, which Proto thinks suited Mr. Amato well from such years. Proto
met Mr. Amato for the very first time in both individual’s lives when Proto was standing outside the junior high school on
the sidewalk and Proto had a caterpillar in Proto’s hands. Mr. Amato started talking to Proto and started a conversation with
words that were something along the sort ‘Hey, you’ve got a caterpillar there...’. Mr. Amato was – thin, skinny, sexy,
attractive – during those years when he was in junior high school, and Mr. Amato also had a voice that was typically
attractive sounding to Proto, along with what Proto thought was an attractive personality as well. Proto and Mr. Amato
didn’t really get to know each other though, for Mr. Amato’s protection, as Mr. Amato was a mortal human being who had
and still has a special destiny and future. Like other historicals that Proto had first-hand experience with face-to-face, Proto
overall probably didn’t seem appealing to Mr. Amato and likely seemed like a dork and social idiot to Mr. Amato during
those years, although such was predictable and expected behavior for Mr. Amato given that Mr. Amato was just a human
being and Proto was not, irregardless of the fact that both Proto and Mr. Amato were born on the same planet yet not the
same species or spiritual nature, as well as the fact that Mr. Amato was born as a mundane human being and as such a
species of non-magical nature, and Proto was born a mundane and non-mundane magical/enchanted being, irregardless of
the fact that Proto never knew this and was mistakenly led to think that Proto was always an ordinary mundane human being
like Mr. Amato. Mr. Joseph Amato, during junior high school days and high school days, when he had his spike-top haircut,
was ‘vanilla’ regarding his face and voice and personality and mannerisms and such.

Obsidian

‘Obsidian’, Face is derived-from/created-from 002 Justin Tyler Berfield, American film and television actor, born
February 25 1986, Agoura Hills, CA (California). Mr. Berfield’s face and voice and likeness in other ways, in acting
performances, were ‘vanilla’ to Proto, from 1995 to 2001, photos are on the website at
http://www.teenidols4you.com/gallery/194/justinb.html from such performances. Note that Proto is unaware of Mr.
Berfield’s personality (the actor, not the same as characters he’s played in TV shows and films), but suspects that Mr.
Berfield is rather intelligent, and certainly more intelligent than some of the roles he has played, including his role as
‘Reese’ in ‘Malcolm in the Middle’ where Mr. Berfield appeared to Proto to be deliberately playacting an idiot and total
bumbling shithead, and clown of sorts, for his role in the television series, as part of his career as an actor. Like most
television series and many films which are comedies, Mr. Berfield also appeared to Proto to be playacting exaggerated and
extreme emotions that normal human beings of American 1990s culture do not have and should not have.

Iolite

‘Iolite’, face is derived from chosen 004 Jonathan ‘Jon’ Gregory Brandis, American celebrity actor, born April 13,
1976, Danbury CT (Connecticut), died/deceased November 12, 2003, LA (Los Angeles) CA (California), in real. His –
face, voice, personality, likeness - as Proto perceived over the years, when Mr. Brandis was in ‘The Neverending Story 2’ to
when Mr. Brandis was in ‘Sidekicks’ and ‘Ladybugs’, is vanilla, and Proto likes at least some of such with regards to Mr.
Brandis’s performance in ‘The Stepfather II’, and overall has been invariably good or at least neutral when Mr. Brandis was
in such films and TV shows throughout such ages. Of all of the movie/film characters aforementioned that Mr. Brandis
played, Proto’s favorite personality that seems the best for Iolite is Mr. Brandis’s performance in ‘LadyBugs’, irregardless of
the fact that Proto finds that Mr. Brandis’s performance in both ‘Sidekicks’ and ‘Ladybugs’ is sexually appealing, regarding
face, personality, likeness, facial expressions, voice, etc. Proto could tell during a few segments of ‘Ladybugs’ when Mr.
Brandis was clearly playacting (which was his job, being an actor), and not necessarily how he would do so if he wrote the
scripts and made the films himself, not necessarily if he were not being an actor and were just socializing with friends of his
and playacting someone, for various reasons (including mocking someone, or imitating someone, or as part of a joke about
someone, or describing what someone did, and related stuff that American teenagers do with their friends in the 1990s).

Pyrax

‘Pyrax’, face is derived from original 007 Eric ‘Drottar’/’Droder’, who went to the same junior high school and the
same high school as Proto, and was in the same grade as Proto, graduating class of 1996, and was in many of the same
classes as Proto. Eric explained, with personality, the difference between a ‘grower’ and a ‘shower’ for Proto who was so
far behind and needed it, after the end of gym-class/phys-ed-class/physical-education-class in junior high school, which was
North Olmsted Junior High School, which was located in the town of North Olmsted, Ohio, zip code 44070, which has been
torn down and replaced sometime during the second decade of the 21st/twenty-first century CE/AD on Planet Earth, real
life, in real. Proto remembers Mr/Mister ‘Drottar’ as a skinny kid in junior high school and high school, including
throughout all of high school and graduation, and remembers him as skinny and giddy over some joke or something as he
and the dark hearted queen, using her common vessel, were leaving the graduation ceremony at some place in downtown
Cleveland or nearby. Eric might have been laughing at Proto, or some other joke [though Proto was certainly worth
laughing at and making fun of back then], and likely/probably saw the dark hearted queen’s common vessel as they walked
by. That was the last time Proto ever saw Eric as a skinny boy of any kind, young and healthy for a human, and might have
been the first time Eric ever saw the dark hearted queen’s common vessel, at least the first time that Proto ever witnessed
such. Proto had no idea Eric would grow up to become a cop/police-officer, something Proto honors and respects. Proto
was also shocked and surprised to find out after the fact what happened to Eric, when he was a police officer who stopped to
help out a stranded motorist on the side curb on a highway while on duty, and got run over by a big truck, something most
human beings likely wouldn’t survive with such a vehicle hitting them on foot if they are on a highway. Proto found out at
least a year later after it happened, when he stumbled across a news article on the Internet by dumb blind luck, with a video
clip as part of a news report, where Eric was interviewed and shown going through rehab/rehabilitation after brain damage
from the accident, and was then struggling to continue a career in law enforcement, and got jobs as a campus police officer
at CSU/Cleveland-State-University as well as a security officer at NASA Glenn Research Center after the accident. Proto
remembers that Eric no longer lived in the town of North Olmsted but moved to a nearby town, still in or near Cuyahoga
County in NE/Northeast OH/Ohio, and had gotten married, and had a wife and two kids/children [human English,
American].

Half zarakite sky boys with Cheetah faces are mute as far as any spoken and written language goes, although their
vocal cords do make feline-like dragon noises of various sorts characteristic of zarakites and half zarakites. When
communicating with written and typed language, for example with wristwatches and, for example, a video game one of
them might create, they use zarakite dragon sounds spelled out, such as ‘purrrrr’ instead of ‘hey, sounds great!’ and
‘ROAAAARRRRRRR!!!!!!!’ instead of ‘piss off!’, etc.

Cobalt

‘Cobalt’, face is derived from chosen 013 Thomas John Guiry, American film actor, born October 12, 1981, Toms
River, NJ (New Jersey). He is ‘vanilla’ from how he looked, sounded, and his character’s personality as Proto thought Proto
could read from Mr. Guiry, in the 1994 film Lassie as ‘Matthew Turner’.

Jet

‘Jet’, Face is created-from/derived-from 014 Charles ‘Chuck’ Hammel, who has a physical face, facial expressions,
and perceived personality that Proto thought and thinks Mr. Hammel had, during junior high school and high school years,
when Mr. Hammel had a ‘spike-top’ hairstyle much like how Mr. Hammel styled such when he and Proto were in sixth
grade, which is vanilla. Mr. Hammel was also ‘vanilla’ (complete, face and voice and personality and facial expressions and
everything else) to Proto the rest of junior high school at least, and regarding high school, Proto simply doesn’t remember.
When Mr. Hammel grew long and somewhat wavy hair, Proto didn’t find that attractive, and such also made Mr. Hammel
look more like the dark prince’s common vessel.

Leopard

‘Leopard’, face is derived from 025 Nathan ‘Nate’ J Pallotta, who went to the same junior high school and same
high school as Proto, graduated from the same class, and was in some of the same classes as Proto. Proto liked Mister
Pallotta, and was interested in being friends with him, but felt Mr Pallotta was untouchable because Proto was too much of a
dork and Mr Pallotta seemed like an in-crowd popular kid to Proto. Mister Pallotta certainly did good for his own kind, and
accomplished much, growing up and having a family and his own human children, as well as his own home, things Proto
never accomplished. Granted, to be fair, Proto is another species that takes much longer to grow up and mature, unlike Mr
Pallotta’s, um, ur, species, not that Mister Pallotta or Proto actually knew about it… Mister Nathan Pallotta was certainly
one who Proto enjoyed masturbating over, over the years, doing it how he did it, and visualizing Mr Pallotta how he would,
knowing that Mr Pallotta was probably a bit different underneath his clothing, as usual, and not imagining Mr Pallotta ever
growing old and musty or anything. As usual with people Proto would masturbate over, Proto never told Mr Pallotta or
anyone else, including anyone at school, or anywhere else, ever, because, like other people Proto would masturbate over,
Proto would imagine that Mr Pallotta would, uh, take it a little… er… Well, let’s just say that while Proto took a long time
to learn to say ‘Hi, How ya doing?’ and for a long time didn’t know how to start a conversation [too young?], let’s just say
that, uh, there are good ways to start a conversation with a human being, and bad ways to start a conversation with a human
being, and other ways that that go totally out the window and out into deep space and don’t come back, and take a human’s
stable steady pulse [as in heart rate] with it, along with one’s sanity, to be technical about it before bringing into the equation
things like ‘decency’ and ‘compassion’ and, uh, just plain leaving out shit that you just don’t do, yikes… Oh, and
somewhere in there is a little thing called common sense. No really, they say that it isn’t common, but, trust me, this one
actually is there, believe it or not, for even the most weird fuckers among the human species. Okay, the author of this text is
a bit choked up now, and will just simply mention at this point that Mister Pallotta as he appeared in Proto’s yearbook
looked too old and too business-like and too grown up past the good years worth living for Proto’s sexual taste, and Proto
certainly did enjoy imagining/visualizing Mr Pallotta as a teenager and adolescent of some age, taking into account his
somewhat short stature, which itself didn’t interfere with Mr Pallotta sexual attractiveness and sexiness to a zarakite’s sex
drive, and works with Mister Pallotta’s face, much like how other chosen have statures that seem to work with their faces,
for the most part at least, to use shitty grammar again, dammit. As if…

down to about fifteen or fourteen years old.

heterosexual, non-psychic, human, always non-infected and non-infectious, a film actor born September 7, 1978 in
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Proto thought that what this face was based upon was a natural blond, for many
years. Mr. Sawa’s performance in the film ‘Little Giant’ published in 1994 was vanilla (complete). Contrary to fucked-inthe-head psychic failsafe teams and their belligerent and infected and infectious personalities, Proto never thought that Mr.
Sawa was gay or homosexual, never thought that Mr. Sawa sounded like a little girl, and never thought that Mr. Sawa was
any kind of a dork or dweeb or infected personality to begin with before 2014 Common Era. Proto also never though of or
imagined Mr. Sawa talking with any lisp or speech disorder, and never thought that Mr. Sawa suffered from any such
disorder or sickness, in absolute.

Almandine

‘Almandine’, Face is derived from chosen 032 Steve Schlaf, age 16 and under, male, non-Negro, heterosexual,
non-psychic, human, always non-infected and non-infectious, German nationality from both parents, his two parents have
family names which are the German names for ‘great’ and ‘sleep’, blond-haired blue-eyed, socially popular, physically
attractive to many of his peers, numerous shallow friendships, a younger brother in his family, shorter than Proto (he stood
as what Proto called ‘a head shorter than myself’ regarding how tall Mr. Schlaf was when Proto was giving him a leather
motorcycle jacket that no longer fit himself in the parking lot after class one day, and Proto felt the jacket no longer fit him
and when he saw how it fit on Mr. Schlaf ‘perfectly’ as Proto would put it Proto ‘knew’ [as Proto would say] that the jacket
would likely never fit him again and decided to simply leave it in Mr. Schlaf’s hands as a gift but told Mr. Schlaf that he
didn’t have to keep it if he didn’t want to and Proto wouldn’t care either way, and the jacket went from the trunk of Proto’s
car to Mr. Schlaf’s car, and that was the end of Proto seeing the jacket again, which Proto was just fine with). Mr. Schlaf
has a history of migraine headaches and had occasional issues with such when Proto knew him (socialized with him), Mr.
Schlaf and Proto both enrolled in the same Philosophy 1010 class (taught by a professor named Mr. Harisumchuk) who was
a friendly and lively man who wasn’t afraid to mock himself (and would sit on the desk in the front of the room instead of in
the chair while he lectured, and would verbally make a reference to his ‘fat ass’ and slap the desk while giving a lecture, and
behave with a personality consistent with such as he would lecture). Mr. Schlaf and Proto were also enrolled in the same
Speech class taught by a woman professor who was a bit weird at times, and oblivious to when Proto was talking to her and
informing her of something related to academic stuff, and she spoke very little and just nodded her head like a robot while
not looking at Proto with her eyes (anywhere near Proto’s face, but looked down). Proto told her a few other things related
to classwork and grades and such, and she repeated the exact same behaviors, characteristic of a robot, acting like a
machine. Proto then felt something weird was going on with the professor and got bold and uncouth and playfully said
‘You know, your hair is on fire and you might want to stick it in a nearby toilet soon’ and the professor then repeated the
same exact behaviors once again, like a robot, just the same, which Proto personally found amusing/funny and thought to
himself in some phrasing/choice-of-words in his head ‘Man, I should tell Steve (Schlaf) about this, he’d get a kick out of it’
(‘getting a kick out of it’ in this context casually means that Mr. Schlaf would have found the situation and specifically the
professor’s reaction to be amusing/funny/humorous as well as unusual, according to what Proto would guess Mr. Schlaf
would find interesting and funny, although, granted, it isn’t like Proto is or was a mind-reader or a psychologist or anything.
At the very least, Proto found it funny, and to this day he thinks that Mr. Schlaf at the time would have found it funny as
well, with comparable and-or compatible humor. Zare has this type of humor and wants and can imagine Tiger’s Eye Jade
SwiftWing’s heads as well as most sky boys as well as Almandine sky boys to have the same type of humor, more or less).
Mr. Schlaf and Proto also developed a social habit out of friendship of walking out of the classroom together and through
the parking lot to each other’s cars after Speech class was over, and talking about stuff during the walk, socializing. Mr.
Schlaf and Proto also witnessed and experienced and were victimized by a first-hand experience of mind-control and-or
thought-control in the classroom one day with hypnosis and sleepiness and partial loss of consciousness on at least Proto’s
part as Proto was hypnotized and led to stare down Mr. Schlaf’s shirt in a way that Proto would never do under normal
circumstances out of decency and basic common sense as well as basic civilized behavior and also compassion for Mr.
Schlaf which Proto is sure Mr. Schlaf would not take too kindly too and would be quite surprised in a way that Mr. Schlaf
would not like and perhaps be ‘scared shitless’ of according to what Proto would imagine of Mr. Schlaf. Proto also would
have considered and also today considers such an unsafe and bad situation that does not qualify as a safe prank or joke, and
wouldn’t find funny, and would be upset about, for himself and Mr. Schlaf’s sake. Proto was then very surprised by Mr.
Schlaf coping with and taking the situation so well afterwards during the walk outside later in the parking lot, and would to
this day say ‘I felt sorry for him, but felt he was really taking it rather well, considering.’ Proto was also surprised that Mr.
Schlaf was forgiving enough to still be a friend with Proto afterwards, although Proto did notice that Mr. Schlaf made a
brand-new habit after the experience of wearing a white undershirt or something similar underneath any shirt with buttons
on it after the incident, so that the undershirt would cover up parts of Mr. Schlaf’s neck and chest that would otherwise be
exposed as Mr. Schlaf would typically wear such shirts with the upper few buttons unbuttoned and open. The incident
included massive stimulation and-or exaggeration of a concept of Mr. Schlaf at one time telling a story about an injury while
riding a bicycle where he ended up with a handlebar of the bicycle penetrating into Mr. Schlaf’s chest and then Mr. Schlaf
then required emergency medical care. Proto, under normal circumstances, would normally never care to actually see what
any old injury from the accident looked like, and would have and to this day would still feel it would be very out-of-place
and offensive and socially inappropriate and evil to Mr. Schlaf to ask what the injury looks like in any typical
circumstances, and such a hypothetical out-of-place question spoken to Mr. Schlaf would certainly ‘freak out’ Mr. Schlaf

ask Mr. Schlaf such a thing as a friend in Proto’s situation, according to what Proto can imagine would likely be a likely real
life hypothetical situation. Proto to this day feels that Mr. Schlaf was not ever a dork or schizo-typical or infected
personality, and such was at least true when Mr. Schlaf was a teenager according to Zare’s judgment, and that although Mr.
Schlaf was born from a different generation than Teenage Target Culture, Zare sees Mr. Schlaf as having a personality and
nature and experience compatible with and part of Teenage Target Culture according to Zare’s judgment and desires. Zare
also remembers Mr. Schlaf’s face and voice when Mr. Schlaf was eighteen and nineteen as - extremely sexually appealing, a
rare find in a good way, attractive, and what Zare would call ‘darling’ in Zarakite English among other terms synonymous
with ‘sexy’ and ‘extremely sexually attractive in a rare way’ and ‘very stimulating in a way that makes one desirable as a
friend’. Zare also enjoys and finds humorous various stories Mr. Schlaf told Proto including telling a cop (police officer)
with Mr. Schlaf keeping a straight face ‘Sir, you are pointing at the wrong pillar’ in a playful way when the policeman was
angry and lecturing Mr. Schlaf after the cop lost his temper at Mr. Schlaf and possibly some of Mr. Schlaf’s friends he was
out with. Almandine would act and behave the same way as Mr. Schalf did if telling a story of the same sort in a situation
with the same circumstances, all inclusive. Zare also enjoys the way Mr. Schlaf and Almandine would both say ‘that would
suck’ which Mr. Schlaf taught Proto and Proto later found useful with some guy in an office referring to the idea/concept of
discussing stuff for therapy in a broom closet instead of an office with a clinical psychologist who was also a criminal
psychologist. Zare further likes and enjoys how Mr. Schlaf and Almandine would hold up one of his hands and playact a
feline cat extending claws and hissing in anger, to describe a woman’s reaction to a situation of Proto not showing up in
class later and related circumstances. Zare also finds Mr. Schlaf’s and Almandine’s reaction (Almandine’s reaction would
be both the same as and also based upon Mr. Schlaf’s reaction) to Proto offering to help Mr. Schalf with an assignment
when Mr. Schlaf and Proto were just getting to know each other to be a natural and normal reaction to the circumstances, all
inclusive. Almandine would also shake his gently side to side with his mouth closed to say ‘no’ to something as Proto
remembered Mr. Schlaf did at one time. Almandine is also socially popular much like Proto witnessed and noticed many at
Tri-C would greet Mr. Schlaf and socialize with Mr. Schlaf in various places and situations at the college/school, and such is
not an exact or absolute match, but rather close, all inclusive. According to what Zare wants, this face, with all
personalities, is based off of Mr. Steve Schlaf’s face as ‘vanilla’ (literal one-for-one match with facial features which are
identical in absolute including facial expressions and vocal cords and how his voice sounds with all potential emotions and
how Mr. Schlaf would use his voice and make it sound for all potential hypothetical situations, irregardless of the fact that
the derived face for a sky boy of any tier does not have the same DNA and instead has genetics for a sky boy of Zare’s
children) for when Mr. Schlaf was eighteen, nineteen, twenty, and sixteen years old, ‘nuff said.

39

Gold

‘Gold’ is face 39, and this face is derived from Original 038 Brian, one who Proto has recently (in the last several
years) called ‘Blond-haired Brian’, who Proto remembers as being short, very skinny, and was sitting in the back/last row of
the Website Programming Class Proto also attended at Cuyahoga Community College, next to a dark-haired guy named
‘Alex Szurka’ or something close to such. Alex at one point gave Proto his phone number, and Alex turned out to be a
drummer who knew Bruce Calvin Lyon before Mr Lyon died. [Mister Lyon was at one time a guitar teacher who taught
Proto how to play electric guitar, and gave him lessons at Westgate Music Center and Village Music, both located in
northeast Ohio in the Greater Cleveland Area’s west side suburbs.]
Brian has natural blond hair, natural blue eyes, and shook hands with Proto either the last day or one of the last
days of the class, saying ‘If I don’t see you again, have a nice life’ and mentioned he would be around, in programming (‘in
programming’ in this case referring to studying computer programming classes at the college).
On the day of the final exam, Brian mentioned after he and Proto both took the exam, outside in the hallway, that
the professor had the answers to the entire exam at the bottom of the last page of the exam. Proto himself didn’t notice this
when he took the exam until after taking the entire exam, and turned in his completed exam anyways, being his normal and
natural self who wanted to be honest and not a cheater, and a ‘goody-two-shoes’ or ‘altruistic do-gooder that everyone hates’
[for being too rule-following and never breaking any rules, and never getting a detention in any school, and never pranking].
Proto also remembers when he and Brian were both waiting outside the classroom before class started and the two
of them were both talking about music, and Brian mentioned that he liked the band ‘Disturbed’ and Proto mentioned that he
wrote his own music, and in his whacked-out fucked-up state, told Brian that he [Proto] thought Brian would like to try his
[Proto’s] own original music. [No wonder Brian had to be protected…] Brian also had a conversation with Proto where
Brian seemed to be turning to Proto and treating Proto like some sort of wise old man or wise elder of sorts for advice and
wisdom of some philosophical sort or guidance, telling Proto ‘I haven’t figured out what I want to do with my life yet’ (if
Proto were human, this would have actually been a logical and sensible thing for a young boy to do in Teenage Target
Culture, to learn to be smart and ahead of peers who would ignore ‘old people’ and not grow up as fast, or at all).
Proto also recalls seeing Brian talking to someone else in a hallway, without greeting or talking to Brian, and he
had part of his hair long and in a spike or something, poking upwards. Proto also remembers when he was downstairs in the
middle of the Galleria area of the campus near the vending machines, sitting at a table and reading something, with his
reading material in front of him blocking much of his face, and Brain was waiting in line for getting what was probably
coffee or some other drink, wearing his [Brian’s] blue down-insulated coat/jacket, and Brian did a double-take or triple-take
in jaw-dropped astonishment that Proto found amusing and would later joke about. Proto thought that most likely Brain’s
reaction had to do with the fact that Proto had a beard when the two of them were both in the website programming class
during the first half of the first decade of the 2000s Common Era, and when Brian saw Proto downstairs near the vending
machines and coffee shop, Proto had shaved off his facial hair. Proto was reading something in his hands that blocked
Brain’s view of the lower half of Proto’s face, with the way that Proto was sitting in his chair, and Proto casually lowered
what he was reading when he saw Brian, which Proto realized revealed the lower half of his face. Proto’s beard that he used
to have was rather thick, and made him look a lot older than he really was, especially with the long hair tied in a ponytail
and the black leather biker (motorcycle enthusiast) jacket he wore, the same jacket Proto later found no longer fit his fat ass,
and gave away to another of the Originals, Mr Steve Schlaf. Apparently Brian saw Proto and thought Proto still had a
beard, and wasn’t expecting to see Proto’s face without any facial hair. The fact that Proto’s former beard was rather thick
and made a striking difference to Proto’s face compared to being clean-shaven probably had something to do with Brian’s
astonished look on his cute face, literally jaw-dropped and mouth hanging open, a ‘Polaroid moment’ that Proto later
laughed over when thinking about what happened and Brian’s ‘holy shit’ mentality. Seeing the literal double-take or tripletake on Brain’s cute face really was a treat, it looked right out of a Hollywood movie. [Note that ‘cute’ printed here is the
Zarakite American English ‘cute’, ay-holes, and not the human ‘cute’, so don’t get any weird ideas, geez…..] Something

tells Zare that the look on Brian’s face is indeed going to be seen again, on one out of a hundred, as the saying goes, with
every pulse and such, loving and adorable.
Brian also sat next to or near another student in the programming class, a human named Jason Ziolkowski, during
at least some of the semester.
Brian was imagined plenty of times in MD (masturbation dreams) as having his head detach and reattach
harmlessly and playfully while being a student in an imaginary recreation [like other MD, common and typical of Zare of
SkyCrown] of the website programming class, sometimes with a remote-controlled toy car moving his detached head
around the table and classroom [mostly the table] that a human could probably purchase at Toys R Us or something, and in
other MD a similar battery-powered or something toy spider that would move around the table, etc. Other MD featured
Brian’s head detaching in the public computer lab areas that were outside of classrooms where students would come and go
between classes to do stuff on the computers, and Brian’s head would somehow hook up to a USB port or something, then
reattach later, casual and convenient like that of a sky boy.
Other MD had Brian detaching his penis which would double as a flash drive and plug into a USB port, then
reattach to himself later when Brian was done using his penis for such a thing.
Brian was also in repeated MD where he was bullied while using a public men’s room that was something like the
upstairs bathroom at the same college near where the website programming class was. Like in all MD, Proto wasn’t present
in any version of the scenario, as if he didn’t exist. Brian was however taken by surprise by some non-descript young
humans who were like high-school bullies, who detached or ripped off Brian’s head while Brian was standing up and taking
a leak in front of one of the urinals [not inside one of the stalls with any door], and pushed Brian’s head into the urinal while
his body he was detached from continued to urinate or whatever onto Brian’s face and into the urinal, and Brian didn’t
bother to pick up his head and instead just continued to pee on himself, down his face and into the urinal, until he was
finished peeing. In at some of the MD of such Brian then picked up his head after he was ‘done with his business’ as a
human might put it, and washed off his head and his blond hair in the sink and such, and probably reattached it later.
In all MD that featured Brian, he was imagined with meaning and intent [applicable to MD, as presumed] to be just
as old as he was in the website programming class, and with the same haircut and same blond hair that made him extremely
attractive to the Zarakite Sex Drive, a teenager and a ‘human’ so to speak. [As usual with MD, such so-called ‘humans’
imagined in MD before Type Five not only survive but are naturally unharmed by casual decapitation and detachability as
well as dismemberment of their body and such, and have different qualities and characteristics compared to actual real-life
and non-imaginary humans who not only wouldn’t be involved in such things as a regular thing, and wouldn’t grow up with
such as common typical lifestyles, but also wouldn’t survive such things in almost all cases the very first time, of course.
Yikes. Needless to say, real-life non-imaginary humans wouldn’t enjoy doing such things either, not in school, whether they
are goofing off or otherwise, not really as a casual regular thing, I’d think.] [Hey, it’s not like I ever asked Brian or one of
the Originals what they dream about that makes them masturbate, under normal conditions I’m just a little bit more careful
and respectful of them and their, uh, privacy? S--- I hate this, being blackmailed isn’t fun, and I can only imagine how
Brian and the others are going to feel when they read this, I still hope they’re safe, especially given that local police
departments can’t help them with this one, not without the FBI involved, at least with the USA, it’s complicated.]
Regarding the handshake, Proto wanted the handshake to be something special and memorable, and later joked
sarcastically that it was a so-called ‘magic’ handshake. Mr. Brian (aforementioned ‘Brain’ in this paragraph), as Proto
remembered him, had a very difficult personality for Proto to understand and make friends with, yet found very attractive
and appealing and wanted to be friends with quite badly. Proto also remembered making a really bad (dorky in this case)
joke to Mr. Brian about hypothetically purchasing/buying a very expensive computer mouse and expecting/demanding that
it float/levitate in mid-air because of how expensive it was. Understandably, Brain was not impressed and didn’t find it
interesting. (Such was one of Proto’s awful jokes that was not told with any expectation that anyone would laugh, but just
an attempt to socialize, and not be humorous, just interesting, to make friends). Mr. Brian’s blond hair and face and voice
and personality and such that Proto could read, back when both were in the same website programming class at the

school/college, is vanilla, and Proto would have had this one (this chosen, Mr. Brian in this case) in his imagination for a lot
more MD if it were not for other factors plaguing Proto. Proto was told that Mr. Brian forgave Proto, and Mr. was okay/OK
with Proto being an ‘alien’ (extraterrestrial/exosolar/space-alien) that Mr. Brian (incorrectly) thought Proto was. Proto also
repeated a very bad wisecrack in the office where he worked on campus, about how Brian was so thin that Proto joked he
could supposedly string one of his guitars with Brian’s skinny body, a joke that wasn’t funny the first time, as well as
another bad joke about how Brian’s spike-top haircut made him look like an archaic weapon from Western Europe of the
middle ages, a mace, or whatever the thing was that was a straight stiff stick with a spiky metal ball at the end of it, when
Brian would stand up straight. Actually, it was this extremely thin and skinny frame that Brian had that made him look
extremely sexually attractive to Proto. Proto also would joke about greeting Brian then saying ‘Hi! Here, EAT this!’
because Brian had such a healthy thin body that more should have. (Proto actually didn’t get a chance to say any such dork
humor to Brian, thankfully, as the poor guy went through a lot already.) Proto also remembers at least one day that Brian
was able to lug around a rather large backpack that looked like it had a lot in it. (The Dark Hearted Prince and the Dark
Hearted King would both joke that the backpack was larger than Brian was, and the Victimist plastic personality that the
dark hearted trio created and forced upon Proto would likely say some extraneous and long-winded dumb shit about
proportions and mass of the backpack and Brian’s body, and likely damage Brian for life upon hearing such unholy
psychically infectious shit going into his ears if the dark hearted trio had really gotten their way in closer to totality.)

Right now Zare is uncertain, much like this author, whether or not Gold-faced dragon sky boys have blue and blond
hair, or just blond hair. Zare wants what is best for his Gold-faced children irregardless, although there are things he doesn’t
know, and he doesn’t know what he would want if he hypothetically knew more, regarding Gold-faced dragon sky boys as
well as Brain himself that he currently is quite worried for and cares about, amid so much going on left and right, just like
many other unborn and unreborn children he is still fighting to hang on to. One should note that its not just Zare, but also
his ‘dragon’, his Zarakite Sex drive which has so much say in what he would want and wants, although that sex drive also
has values and logic and personality and sentient intelligence that matches the head brain, and also cares, even though it
certainly isn’t the same, and neither are the minds of the torso that lie in-between.
That and, contrary to someone else’s nonsense, ‘Raxx’ is meant as an actual name, serious minded the whole time,
and not some idiotic ‘pet kid on a leash with a food dish in front of him’ type of mentality. If Zare wanted that, he might as
well call him ‘Fido’ or something. One could say that Zare, or Proto, or whatever, feels about as compelled to call Brian’s
uncle ‘Fido’ as he is to call Brian himself ‘Spud’, and we all know how much Brian would just love to go by that name,
don’t we? ****ers…..

Emerald

‘Emerald’, face is derived from 042 William ‘Billy’ Zegas, whom Proto remembered over the years as ‘Billy’ from
German class at North Olmsted High school, who came over from the middle school for German class, cute and adorable as
well as delicate and precious to The Zarakite Sex Drive, certainly vanilla when Mr Zegas was a student in that German
class, with his red-haired classmate who was also very much the same to the Zarakite Sex Drive while they were in the
class, both vanilla back in those days, and both coincidentally Originals [note that ‘cute’ and ‘adorable’ and other adjectives
used here are not human English terms, but are used as they are in Zarakite American English language relevant to the
Zarakite Sex Drive, and not as a human from the USA would use them or imagine them, with regards to presumed ideas and
concepts that one imagines and thinks of when they read and hear such words etc, if they are a human being]. Proto also
recalls seeing Mister Zegas in hallways and such in two or three later years in North Olmsted High School, also very
attractive to The Zarakite Sex Drive in much the same ways, as well as of course a little bit taller [as expected]. Both Mister
Zegas and his classmate were in plenty of extensive MD from how they looked back then, in particular imagined and meant
and intended [maybe those two words also work here, thought I’d try them out in this sentence] as how they looked and
seemed to ‘the dragon’ back then in that class [throughout most of the class, as Mr Zegas’s classmate did dress up in a dress
as a gag on Halloween for a one-day-only thing, although such was not how he was ever envisioned in any MD, at least by
Proto who instead always imagined both in normal dress for the culture back then and related MD ‘culture’ and a bit of
Teenage Target Culture, approximately]. Proto actually didn’t feel like talking to or approaching either one of them during
those years, as he had his own, uh, situation, and quite frankly didn’t want to intimidate or scare either one of them with
himself, or his dragon, and control himself as such. This has nothing to do with anything more than compassion and caring
for Mr Zegas and his classmate and what Proto would imagine would give them heart attacks and be too much for them,
after all they were only innocent adorable and delicate human beings, boys who could only take so much, and that sort of
thing is precious and delicate and something to be very careful about, and not to scare half to death or drag through thick
and thin and leave looking like hammered s--- bloody beaten and roughed up and anything but beautiful and worth some
heavy masturbating over and a serious loving and also sexual relationship. [Sorry, being DIPLOMATIC here is right out the
window, beyond my reach at the moment unfortunately, but at least beating around the bush isn’t what’s going on here.]

Copper

‘Copper’, faced is derived from 043 ‘Ferret’, High school German class, junior high school student, red hair, wore
a dress for just one day, Halloween, although Proto remembers and masturbated over him remembering and visualizing him
as a boy, dressed as a boy. Until the exosolar-incident/type-five-incident in North Olmsted, Proto remembered this person’s
name over the years, including long after high school and into Proto’s thirties, although a hostile takeover of Proto’s allies,
one that involved the CIA and sponsored/backed/initiated by the dark hearted trio and the dark hearted FBI and other dark
hearted officials from North Eastern Ohio who included many who were compromised and mind controlled by the dark
hearted trio who are hostile mind controllers from worlds other than planet Earth, changed this. After such a hostile
takeover happened, which also victimized Illuminati and secret societies world-wide as casualties, Proto’s memories of this
original, the basis for this face of the chosen, were corrupted because of thought control technology the CIA stole and
indulged in as acts of treason and terrorism. Because of this, Proto is unable to remember the name of this person, who he
remembers as a boy in German class in high school, with a very attractive and ‘vanilla’ face, although Proto does remember
that he used to be able to easily remember his name without difficulty before the CIA became involved and made itself a
terrorist organization hostile to all human species and governments and all future human species governments and all future
administrations of such. Such incident actually proved and established, as a point-of-no-return connection point, one that
occurred in real life and not any planning, that what happened in North Olmsted, the exosolar incident, was indeed very
real, actually happened, and actually altered real life history, and cannot be forgotten or ignored, and Proto isn’t allowed or
able to forget or ‘be put back on a shelf’ as the CIA and other ‘internals’ and USA administration victimized and taken over
by hostile exosolar mind controllers and hostile exosolar though control has wanted and tried to make happen repeatedly
among efforts to further victimize all life on planet Earth and all future life on planet Earth and many other worlds by
making such life victims and casualties of the dark hearted trio and other exosolar mind controllers and exosolar thought
controllers of evil and hostile nature, while the entire time deliberately and knowingly leaving Proto disempowered and
never given any means to do anything about it and blaming Proto the entire time for such, and claiming to give Proto
options to be empowered but only by becoming a mind controller species that is a pet and captive creature always controlled
by future human being administrations run by CIA and human intelligence agencies that love and embrace dark hearted trio
values and culture, including spies everywhere along with psychiatric illnesses for the masses, and mass mind control and
mass thought control for the masses for all future generations, all while lying to and deluding the public, and then building a
multi-solar empire with such ideals and cultures, spanning many galaxies and star systems, and lying to and misleading
human politicians the entire time with a dark hearted queen style promise of some ‘escape hatch’ or ’golden parachute’ for
human administration government fat cats and cronies left and right, who actually would only be mind controlled and
thought controlled puppets of the dark hearted CIA, yet/but of course such would be totally ‘invisible’ in that the puppet
human policy-makers would continue to appear to each other and the masses to be ordinary human beings, and never appear
to be otherwise, and everything would always be hidden and subtle and super-secret for all time, so that no one would ever
allegedly know, which of course would also be the CIA’s approach to exosolar species of other worlds left and right across
many galaxies, mind controlling and thought controlling them without them noticing, extremely spy-like and deceptive, and
always having the option to blame Proto as a fall guy as a backup/backstop/failsafe.

TigerStone

‘TigerStone’, Face is derived from chosen 056 informally named ‘Tony’ as an alias, age 16 and under, male, nonNegro, heterosexual, non-psychic, human, always non-infected and non-infectious, non-dark-hearted, non-dark-hearted-trio,
non-evil, good, natural blond hair, blue eyes, not based on any specific human being’s face that ever existed although
viewing the head from the back and at a slight side angle as well as slightly from above reminds Proto sometimes of a
memory of Mr. Steve Schlaf walking outside into a parking lot from a school, the same Mr. Schlaf which Almandine is
based upon/off-of, with regards to the jaw joint and muscle and shape and such. Proto has modeled what is close to this
face and 056 in a computer program called ‘Blender’ which does 3D modeling on computers that Proto is familiar with and
something like what Tiger’s Eye Jade SwiftWing of Zare’s Children has at least some familiarity with.
TigerStone is much like Proto, and has Proto’s natural sex drive, and honest likes and dislikes, as well as a love for
things Proto never got to try.
Note that for reference, in the Original Texts, which Proto used to play a zarakite during the 1990s in Dungeons
and Dragons with friends in Mr. Hill’s basement, with Mr. Gedra Jr. and Mr. Hill, as well as others, and also in a place
called Reality Recess which used to be at Great Northern Shopping Mall in North Olmsted but later was at a new location
on Brookpark Extension in North Olmsted, in a strip of shops adjacent to Guitar Center Cleveland in North Olmsted, the
zarakites of such Original Texts were not the same species as those of Zare’s Children and Future Focus of Divination, and
had similarities, being non-human enchanted creatures with wings that had feathers and no bones/skeleton in the wings that
would wield magic but also fight with other weapons (which would have included a sword had the rules allowed for such,
and such rules did not allow for any guns or firearms as such imaginary universe was in a European middle-age fantasy),
Proto often played such a pseudo-zarakite species with blue feathers and blue hair, named ‘Zare’. Such pseduo-zarakites
were not shape-shifters and had only two fangs instead of four, and such fangs were found in the upper canine teeth only,
and not the lower, and such pseudo-zarakites did not sting, and did not have claws, and wore other clothing including a
cloak which Proto called a ‘cape’ quite frequently, and such pseudo-zarakites did not have the sex drives or sexuality that
zarakites have of Future Focus of Divination, as Proto did not imagine such back then, and Proto’s friends would have likely
been turned-off/put-off and disgruntled if such sexually perverted ideas had hypothetically come up in conversations and
gameplay with his friends (as well as all the MD Proto had over his friends and school classmates and such, and some
Hollywood film actors he had MD over at the time), and such was never brought up with his friends, he never had
conversations about any of such with his friends during all those years as well as afterwards, never told any of them about
such things, and they never knew and never found out, at least not before 2014 Common Era, and before 2014 Proto never
had any logical reason to think that such old friends knew about any such things, or Proto’s species. Proto’s old friends did
however know, well aware, that Proto did not have any religion during those years, and did not grow up with any religion or
religious background, but did have a serious-minded interest in magic. In more recent times before 2014 Proto did tell some
of the chosen, and classmates at college, about his experiences with practicing Pagan witchcraft, which he took very
seriously, and mention of such came up over time with historicals such as Mr. David Sopata as well as Mr. Schlaf, and
others at the college Tri-C.

Beryl

‘Beryl’, Face is derived from chosen 057 informally named ‘Tyler’ as an alias, age 16 and under, male, non-Negro,
heterosexual, non-psychic, human, always non-infected and non-infectious, Proto doesn’t know his actual name and despite
numerous efforts months apart and such Proto hasn’t been able to figure out what he is confident is his real name, because.
What this face is derived from is a man Proto thought for a long time was blond until he researched a little deeper and found
he wants this guy for his chosen anyways, before he grows up into a man, one of those creatures from Earth that doesn’t
know how to have fun after they get older and they put up with all sorts of nasty shit like getting old and arthritis and other
evil stuff. Irregardless of hair color, Proto is confident that what this face is based upon was wearing contact lenses and of
course posing for the shot in the video, and was probably a clean-cut young guy who took an offer to do something fun.
Regardless, Zare will ensure he has fun and it shall be the real thing, one way or another, and, um, figure it out somehow…
Mr. ‘Tyler’ is the young man from the Slipknot music video ‘Spit It Out’ who makes hand gestures, has his tongue sticking
out in part of the video, has contact lenses that look something like artificial cataracts to Proto, has dark hair with parts of
such bleached to look blond, and has a black T shirt in the video. During parts of the video Mr. ‘Tyler’ (or whatever his
name really is, as Proto was never able to confirm his actual name), has his head either tilted to one side or has it bent
forward, posing for the camera. Proto doesn’t know him, but can imagine Mr. Tyler to be a smart, clean-cut ‘rocker’ type of
Caucasian White sub-urban nice guy, as what he might be, though irregardless Proto has an open mind as such, the type he
usually has about such things, with consistency, even if humans never believe it (and most probably don’t, and never will,
given the current/present and future/upcoming circumstances, without playing dumb about anything and cutting the
crap/shit/bullshit/horseshit/deceptive-playacting).

Ametrine

‘Ametrine’, Face is derived from chosen 065 Jonathan Taylor Thomas, age 16 and under, male, non-Negro,
heterosexual, non-psychic, human, always non-infected and non-infectious, film actor, blond to Proto’s eyes, born
September 8 1981 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA. Like other celebrity film actors listed among the list of chosen, what
this face is based upon is available in pictures/photos and videos on the public Internet (for the masses) on various websites
including Youtube.com. As with all of the chosen, what all faces derived from such should be 16 (sixteen) years old and
younger, yet also not younger than five years old, along with other previously established requirements, to be both as least
dangerous and as least evil as possible, considering. Proto had MD over Jonathan Taylor Thomas as he appeared in the
1995 film ‘Man of the House’.

Feldspar

‘Feldspar’, face is derived from chosen 068 David ‘Dave’ Frindt. Mr. Frindt’s – face, voice, body language,
behaviors, personality, social intelligence, sense of humor, style of humor, style of speaking – that Proto observed, during
the time that Mister/Mr Frindt and Proto were both students in the same classroom at Positive Program Education Center,
are ‘vanilla’ for both sex appeal and general appeal of sky boy senses and personality including but not limited to likes and
dislikes. Mr. Frindt had long straight black hair, took care of his body, was athletic, didn’t seem schizo or psychically
infected at all to Proto, and was also in the same class as an enemy mind controller and possessor and-or vessel of the dark
hearted trio named ‘Jennifer Hartline’, and aforementioned female enemy combatant ‘Jenny Hartline’ has been well
established long term as being deeply connected to the Dark Hearted Queen and at least somewhat the Dark Hearted King,
and she is very psychically infectious in an evil dark hearted trio way as well as photographs and media of her which are
very dangerous to historicals and quickly infects and induces psychiatric issues permanently within the brain tissue and
minds of such historicals. Proto imagined Mr. Frindt quite often in his M.D. over the years, and by comparison next to a
hint of more than nothing Jenny Hartline, although Jenny Hartline’s imagined presence in such was artificial, while Mr.
Frindt’s was always natural and real and genuine. Note that Jenny Hartline was and is, life-long, severely mentally
handicapped in obvious and blatant ways, and has the mind of a sick tiny little schizo-typical and schizoid and dark hearted
trio girl of low intelligence, very psychic and very dangerous.

BloodStone

‘BloodStone’, Face is derived from chosen 078 Timo Sonnenschein, age 16 and under, male, non-Negro,
heterosexual, non-psychic, human, always non-infected and non-infectious, a German citizen who was born 20 September
1987, who one of two front-men and singers/vocalists for the German band ‘Nevada Tan’ which has also been known as
‘Panik’, sings in German and not in English, band is now defunct as of ~2010 CE (Common Era, an alternative to AD to
mark years after zero AD, ‘Common Era’ is an internationally and scientifically accepted alternative which is non-religious
as such doesn’t reference before or after the birth of a man in Christian folklore known as ‘Jesus Christ’ who may have been
born during the summer although some scholars who research outside of speculation hypothesize he never actually existed
and is a mythological figure in Christian mythology, though, granted, scholars disagree and have been subject to bias and
speculation and contrasense). What this face is based off of, like other celebrity musicians on the chosen list, has music
videos available on the public Internet, including Youtube.com.
