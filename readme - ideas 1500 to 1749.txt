Much talk from this forum, one of 1908 posts, including intellectual talks about - theoretical alien speicies, how a hypothetical sentient species evolves on various worlds and resulting characterisitcs, astronomy, serious-minded UFOs and exosolar life that has intelligent and educated non-conspiracy-theory scientific discussions as well as silly and shortsighted ignorant ultra-religious 'quick-and-snappy' paranoid rejection of alien life combined with tin foil hat psychotic talk and other discussions inbetween such, hard sci-fi and soft-sci-fi, intelligent talk as well as Chris-Sandusky-style-logic and what a 'wordoid' is, what a 'freshy' is [slang term, used in Antarctic historical species colonies where such live and such populations also go to [public] school and have local banks and convenience stores] etc, possible references to why some Antarctic human towns that have scientists seem to have an intelligent and clear-headed and non-infected understanding of global climate change and how dangerous funny-looking colored clouds in the sky are yet also 'mail-order' very large supplies of condoms for the six-month winters [believe it or not, there IS a casual, logical relationship between these two concepts, amid crackpot humor], and other stuff... -:

Idea #1500:
     2020-01-15    Common-Era   16:21  EST :  Speaking of Idea #1494 and #1499, I want the non-Nickelodeon version.  Yes please!  [It sounds cheesy, but that's how it's said.  The same request with 'next' is if you want to change the subject, for ANY reason.  It isn't always granted, but its understood.]

Idea #1501:
     2020-01-15    Common-Era   16:21  EST :  I want to figure out what color[s] blood various 'sky boys' have, for what body parts and stuff.

Idea #1502:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   03:38  EST :  Regarding 'Brian' from Akron Children's Hospital, he was a victim of child abuse, and I was supposed to get to know him to learn about child abuse.  That's how he ended up in that psych ward.  If I had gotten to know him then things would have been a lot different from that point on, for me and him.  Because I didn't get to know him, not even his name, Sally Lynn Reeves then had the job of teaching me about child abuse in human culture another way, by doing it to me and not faking it and making me a victim of it.  I don't know what type of abuse he suffered from, and being told what type wasn't established and I also didn't ask.  Also whatever type it was he could have also been a good friend for sexual stuff that no humans do, and kicked off the recruitment program back then with myself getting my own body parts I should have for a tiger dragon zarakite.  He'll still look good with purple and gold hair, which means 'sky boy purple' and 'sky boy yellow' of course.

Idea #1503:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   05:05  EST :  Five types of penises are what 'sky boys' can have, and are - 'sky boy' penis, 'fleshy sky boy' penis, 'fleshy sky boy' penis with vestigal testicles, 'human' penis with working testicles, 'human' penis with no testicles -, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1504:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   05:05  EST :  No one from planet Earth knows even half of psychiatry of the Dark Hearted Queen's type.  No one from planet Earth could ever understand even half of psychiatry of the Dark Hearted Queen's type.  As such, anyone from Earth therefore lacks credibility when discussing anything involving Dark Hearted Queen psychiatry, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1505:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   05:05  EST :  No one from planet Earth knows even half of diabetes of the Dark Hearted Queen's type.  No one from planet Earth could ever understand even half of diabetes of the Dark Hearted Queen's type.  As such, anyone from Earth therefore lacks credibility when discussing anything involving Dark Hearted Queen diabetes, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1506:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:00  EST :  TigerStone boys are very impulsive.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1507:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:00  EST :  All zarakites are at least somewhat impulsive.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1508:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:00  EST :  When the skin color of some 'sky boy' is changed, all body parts that belong to him change to match.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1509:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:00  EST :  When the skin color of some 'sky boy' is changed, all body parts that belong to him change to match.  It doesn't matter what parts are connected or otherwise.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1510:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:00  EST :  There are three versions of body parts that any arbitrary body part can be, for a sky boy as well as a human.  This is irregardless of detachables and what is and is not attached.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1511:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   07:20  EST :  This is a news flash, the solar wyverns have at least two groups now, one that is called 'sun dragons' who are helpful allies, and the other are stoic and impartial in many ways to replace the exosolar 'Japan' that fell and didn't do anywhere enough of what they should have done to survive.  This is the same exosolar 'Japan' that managed Salt and other ingredients and insisted on keeping it steady and unable to make itself improve or get more powerful.  This exosolar 'Japan' also includes many who have become infected and happily disempower salt, and throttle back me going through brain cell changes to become a TigerStone, and also throttle back turning down suppression and let it get turned back on, and in all of these cases they do so with big cheerful smiles on their faces so to speak, and any good they do is brief and far too short to prove anything to anyone that could be used later, and as I see it is also both deceptive and uncooperative.  The one solar wyvern group had to replace them, and there was no other way, and they already just did this just now and already have it going [fully implemented] and won't [and can't] cancel or stop at this point.  They apparently had enough justification.

Idea #1512:
     2020-01-16    Common-Era   21:04  EST :  All of the files at ' https://sourceforge.net/projects/scorchcrafter/files/Sky%20boy%20stuff/videos/2020-01-10/ ', as well as all of the video uploads at YouTube at ' https://www.youtube.com/user/Destructavator/videos ', including the recent ones like ' https://youtu.be/Etevi9G6dvs ' which I'm still uploading [there are 30 of them and they total 64 gigs altogether, in their original format], and more 'avi' video files that I'll have to upload to sourceforge at one or more of my projects.  These videos have content and audio and video that say a lot, about a lot of stuff, and many important discussions, and not just one or two of the many things that are in the many Ideas in the Idea list and other stuff, and even more with one side of some discussions that answer and say a lot when lined up with and in sync with other conversations, a lot of it really important stuff that many already have been keeping up with and remember over time, and need and can't ignore or refuse to 'compete' with, and they keep their own notes and records and need this stuff, and this isn't stuff that just anyone would or can do, which has come up in many of aforementioned, 'nuffs said.  It's interesting what does and doesn't survive mundane and non-mundane things that block remembering these things, as well as what they refer to of course, naturally.  [I was told to use that word and that words like that would be 'cleaned up', and for the good of many.]
	There's also all of the stuff at FaceBook, for the profile 'David Reeves' which also has ' Tiger's Eye Jade SwiftWing ' in parenthesis and a digital render of a TigerStone faced zarakite cheap rendering [with mistakes and errors, although the face has the fewest and other parts have the wrong proportions, and I know the ears of the model in the digital render are messed up, and we've already had discussions about how and what parts and what is and isn't going to be accepted as well as desired by the zarakite sex drive without playing dumb, which have the correct answers that will work and be accepted by recruiters and a working as well as real program, that would actually work and not sound like a joke, of course].  All of the things on that FaceBook profile and the uploads and posts and information, and what all of it refers to, are also included in this Idea and also part of a lot of the talks and discussions and stuff, and also important and 'essential' as Mr Standish says he wants it explained.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1513:
     2020-01-17    Common-Era   01:24  EST :  The zarakite sex drive isn't something that can, should, or ought to be characteristic of a machine or contraption that isn't a natural part of any sky boy or sky girl of ANY type or sort, that could ever be detached or seperated from one's self, or spirit or soul.  Never ever, not even for some extreme situation or emergency, no matter what justification for any improbable thing which is actually more-than-improbable in a literal way.  Failure to do so causes problems that empower and bring about bad space amoebas like Sally Lynn Reeves's posessor, evil dark hearted and dark trio cents that won't die or go away, and even a boring human who fakes being a 'Sallyism' and daytime nursing supervisor's arguements about women having sex and not having pleasure and being detached in so many ways and other mundane non-transcendant traditional human female stuff that they understand easily and don't have to be experts or professionals of any sorts to understand or argue.  Race or skin color makes no difference, or lifestyle really.  Especially when any sort of women like that is old enough, although I'm being told that it applies to all ages and I find that easily believable.  This is why the human female sex drive is so infected permanantly and won't ever go back, and must be replaced, I'm being told is the actual real answer, in real life and in real, and this whole Idea might be correct but either way I'm not going to put scripture to it and let others find out the answer and not mess it up and after all I'm not a female anyways and never will be and never can or ought to be one ever in any life or lifetime or future and as such wouldn't know and can't ever answer this alone but I find it easy to believe as well as imagine.

Idea #1514:
     2020-01-17    Common-Era   01:55  EST :  According to zarakite values an innocent immortal should not be bullied, abused, or allowed to suffer in such ways, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1515:
     2020-01-17    Common-Era   02:00  EST :  Telepathic discussions involving myself and human beings and life of planet Earth, from now [2:00 AM Eastern Standard Time, year 2020 Common Era] through last year, and other likewise discussions.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1516:
     2020-01-17    Common-Era   02:00  EST :  Sky children can be nervous and edgy and anxious when taken out of their comfort zone.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1517:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   13:41  EST :  Dark Hearted values support a 'no snitching' also-known-as 'no tattling' and 'no telling' thing as part of dark hearted values.  Dark hearted values as such support corruption and deliberately 'turning a blind eye' so to speak toward rule-breaking and illicit behavior, as well as 'looking the other way' when illicit behavior that involves breaking rules is noticed.  Zarakite values, by comparison, support one reporting to authority what was witnessed when people are bad, including when one isn't personally involved.  This type of thing has limits though, and is definite and for sure when law-breaking behavior is witnessed, especially that which involves theft and stealing, and even worse when someone's life and safety are at risk.  Zarakite values support a friendly neighborhood where a next-door neighbor accross a street will call someone on a phone to report what looks like a broken-down front door, if they don't know how it broke and just noticed it, and don't know anything about it.  With classrooms at high school zarakite values still have the same default although students will sometimes misbehave and not report it if they see another student misbehave, and this is normal, and still living life overall in zarakite values.  Being a 'teacher's pet' is socially inept which is very bad, and hurts one's reputation and personality which is really bad.  Overall, if in doubt as to where the line is drawn, if it is illicit but not illegal then it varies, but if it is outright against the law then zarakite values require calling police or authority of some sort although who qualifies as 'authority' varies before turning to local law enforcement such as a police department.  If staying at a hotel then the manager or some secretary or worker for hotel management will suffice.  Once the hotel management is going to get word of something illegal that may have happened, its then up to hotel management to involve police and-or lawyers and-or someone else and-or themselves as necessary, and it it their [hotel management's] job and responsibility to do that and no longer any responsibility or fault of anyone staying at the hotel.  Also, once someone staying at the hotel tells a worker at the hotel, if the worker says they will pass it on then the person staying there has done their part and is no longer responible for reporting anything any further.  If the person staying at the hotel isn't personally involved or affected by what he or she reported then the aforementioned person staying at the hotel doesn't typically have to worry about or even remember what they reported.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1518:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   15:20  EST :  Regarding Idea #1517, having zarakite values in place that include what was described in that Idea is a good thing in that it encourages everyday people and citizens to be good instead of law-breaking, and also reduces the need for security cameras in various public and commercial areas and more in towns and cities.  This is logical.  It is also compassionate as opposed to cold and psychopathic.  Compassionate people who care are better, and care about their own, and don't like to see crime occur in their cities and towns.  By comparison cold psychopathic types won't report anything and are actually suicidal in refusing to care to call and report anything they see, because criminals tend not to get caught but instead get away with what they start, and people who won't report crime may in fact be the next victim.  Also, criminals are going to tend to strike again where they think they can get away with it, which includes neighborhoods where they won't call the local police.  For citizens who don't care and won't call the police, I and zarakite values have no sympathy for victims of crime who would never call anyone.  Natural selection is at hand, one should let it happen and allow citizens who care to move in and take their place, which also makes a neighborhood where criminals won't get away with as much and won't try it in the first place, which makes nicer and safer neighborhoods with people that care, which is all-around a GOOD overall thing.  Logic and zarakite values agree, and so does SkyCrowne.  The zarakite sex drive does as well, and does NOT see mug shots of arrested people as 'sexy' in itself, at all, never ever.  Some females find that type of thing sexy, but the zarakite sex drive doesn't.  Then again, the zarakite sex drive isn't female.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1519:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   15:49  EST :  Regarding supercities, the main structure has 4 (four) corner towers and a single center tower, the NE tower, NW tower, SE tower, and SW tower, plus the center tower.  Bridges and other sub-structures that include junctions and have commercial and residential areas are built to be level and even with each other as well as perpendicular to what is completely horizontal according to the surface of the planet and the zenith and horizon in all directions.  Quad center structures, quad edge structures, and quad border structures are all capable of housing various residential and commercial and industrial zones with names and titles that include 'city' or 'town' or 'village' in part of the name in some cases.  What is handwritten by myself in pencil about these archology structures, as well as discussed in a number of conversations, and other related information, applies.  Logic and how things work in real life as what I'm used to, as I handwrote, is also included as well.  So are my flawed hand-drawn diagrams, which were not to scale and had many inaccuracies, but also were the best I could reasonably draw them under the conditions they were hand-drawn in, and were also what should have been expected considering aforementioned conditions.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1520:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   15:49  EST :  All things I wrote and drew and discussed, while at Clearvista, from Friday January 17th 2020 to Friday Februrary 7th 2020, 'nuffs said.
