carnation instant breakfast, any flavor (had these for years, since very little)
ice cream, chocolate, peanut butter and chocolate, vanilla, strawberry
peanut butter and chocolate stuff, including reese's peanut butter cups (had these all the time)
cereal, rice krispies (regular and chocolate), product 19, kix, cocoa puffs, peanut butter cocoa puffs, corn chex, rice chex, shredded wheat, wasn't too fond of life cereal or total but can tolerate such, not allowed to remember the rest...
ham, thin slices - honey ham, brown sugar ham, unflavored not so much - thicker ham slices sometimes pretty good - as long as there are no bone slices or crap, which sometimes happens and tastes fuckin' NASTY
bacon, crispy and slightly burnt, cooked "regular" (I guess), usually not too picky, as long as there is a lot of it, at an all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet with friend - not D.H. - ate a whole big plate of bacon and loved it (note: don't try this at home if you are human, these are zarakite portions - serious issues for humans) - at that restuarant I also had seconds (and no one seemed to stare at me or make a scene, but I had a blast)
turkey bacon, okay, I prefer regular bacon, but I'll eat turkey bacon any time
bologna, oscar mayer brand, had it since very little, at least since grade school and probably earlier, and other times ever since
chicken that is breaded and has no bones, chicken nuggets, chicken patties, similar types of breaded chicken, not picky about brand, had the stuff for many years, nuked is fine, also fried in frying pan with corn oil, nuked in pasta sauce, sometimes good with slice(s) of american cheese, good with seasonings and/or salts, left in a toaster oven is okay even if burnt (as long as the toaster oven survives, long story dude)
sliced chicken, lunch meat style
hot dogs, chicken and/or beef and/or pork, nuked is fine and is usually what I have, oscar mayer brand is one good type, not into larger sized brat-style, the ones I've had I ate for many years, in apartment, before apartment, grade school, etc., once had some weird hot-dog-like thing cooked over a fire place which tasted like shit, I happen to like a lot of food and meats with nitrates
spagettios, don't like the kind with meatballs (hated such, later put up with it sometimes after moving out) but like regular type, especially with my parmesan cheese dish (had spagettios and parmesan cheese for so many years, not always together, but since grade school days and such)
parmesan cheese, had tons over so many years, love the kraft brand (hate the low fat type they have sometimes had over the years, that shit should die and not come back), goes on nearly everything - pasta, rice, pizza, spagettios, pasta which is "naked" (no sauce or anything) as well as with tomato pasta sauce of some kind, spagetti, rigatoni, little shell-shaped pasta, various pastas with tri-colored look, white color was very common over the years, brown color which was whole wheat tasted awful (puke-worthy, couldn't usually finish even half the dish), parmesan cheese goes real fast in my pantry, I'd buy a bunch of cans and cook a bowl of pasta, and use about two-thirds of a can for the bowl of pasta, ate pasta that way for many years, including before and after moving out and getting my own place, more or less
velveeta with pasta, had the stuff for many years, in my apartment and going all the way back to grade school days, maybe earlier, usually would get the type for a family, meant for several large meals not to be cooked all on the same day, but I'd happily cook the whole thing and wolf down the entire box worth, did this all the time over the years with few exceptions
cheese whiz I had when I was little, probably wouldn't mind it again
crackers of darn nearly all kinds, saltines to graham crackers to all sorts of other stuff, mostly cheap stuff, usually I'd put salt on it or have something with it, peanut butter of some kind
peanut butter, really like JIF brand, hate "peter pan" brand as "peter pan" tastes like shit and I can't finish a sandwich made with it but the D.H. queen loves that crap, meanwhile I like JIF both smooth and chunky, enjoy it by itself, with honey, with breakfast syrup on stuff, with chocolate spread, with nutella (that hazelnut spread that isn't chocolate but is also good), hate the "low fat" and "reduced fat" kinds that are disgusting, those have a nasty chemical taste (they are not real peanut butter, but chemically made from such, and are also very bad for human consumption, very unhealthy)
breakfast pastries, waffles (various), pancakes, had many over the years since being very little, didn't like butter but just syrup when very little for some reason, learned how to make chocolate chip pancakes over the years, before and after getting apartment, also made peanut butter pancakes, peanut butter and chocolate pancakes, sometimes with brewed coffee that gave it a good kick to it (fuck passing out after a big plate of my chocolate chip and peanut butter pancakes), still tasty with syrup (any basic cheap stuff works)
toaster strudles, good stuff over the years
pop tarts, generic or name brand, I don't care, good stuff, various flavors, enjoyed as adult and as a child and all times in-between
rice, white rice, long-grain and instant for many years, since very little, tried brown rice, instant brown rice is pretty good but just instant, any rice I like is good with parmesan cheese and/or soy sauce and/or pasta sauce, melted american cheese also works (along with some milk, this combination also works great with pasta of various sorts, can also add bits of chopped onions)
rice-a-roni, various, cooked in a pan (I probably didn't do it right, but I ate it anyways), instant kind that you put in a microwave then tear open the pouch is also good
potatoes, mashed (with milk and butter and salt is really good, I never usually bothered with gravy over the years, but won't complain if gravy is on it, I'd still eat it), microwaved, boiled, microwaved is good with cheese, I like to eat the skin as well (healthy nutrients), I don't bother cleaning them before cooking them (never had problems, a little dirt won't kill ya if you've built up your immune system, and other fun stuff...  For those with a "species issue" or who have "de-evolved" as someone says, no worries, I'll write you a hall pass so you can go to the kitchen and wash your potatoes), white potatoes are good, so are red potatoes, instant potato flakes of various sorts are good, and I've cooked them with other stuff, recipies (zarakite), and such
butter, I like real butter, not margerine stuff, I usually buy salted, in sticks, and slice off sections for all sorts of food, sandwiches, breads, bakery (makes corn bread really melt in your mouth, very tasty when you bake corn muffins with a whole stick added, or in a pan [even with just one six-muffin box, although two boxes work])
corn oil, love the stuff, used it for years, cooking, baking, popcorn in a pot
popcorn, cooked in large cooking pot with lid, made the stuff for years since long before moving out, used zarakite serving of corn oil (large amount) in bottom of the pan, often with salt, made it work a few times with peanut butter too but such is tricky as it burns easy (can melt peanut butter in microwave and pour it on afterwards, accross the whole bowl, mixed with suger and/or chocolate, like cocoa powder, or just peanut butter and sugar), I'd buy yellow popcorn, white popcorn, black popcorn, red popcorn, also blue and purple popcorn kernels for cooking (blue and purple come from amish country, can buy big bags of it cheap from amazon, really good stuff, also such is heart healthy and has less carbs or better glycemic index thing whatever so its really good for diabetics somehow)
microwave popcorn, sorta okay, not as good (tasty) as popcorn made in a cooking pot on the stove, really not as good (healthy, human) as popcorn made in a cooking pot on the stove (fumes can mess up your lungs, sometimes for life, they say, and they're right from what I've heard)
french fries, home fries, microwave, toaster oven, McDonald's are really good, but other fast food fries are pretty good, okay if a day old or fell down between car seat the other day, I don't care (as long as they don't have dirt or crap that ruins the flavor), don't like the curly spicy ones very much, but straight ones are always good, the "waffle" shaped ones are good too, I don't normally eat them with ketchup or any sauce over the years, but usually lots of salt (super-fine salt is good, so it sticks), I hate ones that are too hot and burn the tongue because they are too fresh in fast food places, I don't complain if they have ketchup (hate mustard though), never tried them with mayo like some Europeans do but I really like mayo
mayonnaise, good on darn near anything as a spread or sauce from my experience, I usually like to use a lot of it (zarakite portions, a jar goes fast with sandwiches, etc.)
burgers, should have tried them as a kid, found out I like them (had to move out first and have a cop and his buddy introduce me to one)
sub sandwiches, subway sandwiches are good with most ingredients but I haven't had them too often (missed many chances), jimmy john's I've had a lot of over the years, really enjoy bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo, ham, provolone, onions, cucumber, sometimes "jimmy peppers," pickles, usually extra of all these ingredients on french or other bread (not picky), hate the other ingredients (except never tried their turkey), ordered many times over the years (had to recreate account more than once, whatever)
apples and apple sauce
pears
grapes, especially black and purple, seedless (seeded are hard to eat, didn't like those)
broccoli (cook it soft, if it's rubbery I'll hate it)
edamame, cooked in the green part and salted, also cooked pre-shelled, can be mixed with other vegetables and stuff, tasty, has very good protien, enjoyed it cooked both ways plenty of times for a number of years, mostly in my apartment, gives me a weird headache if I have too many at once, and not from the salt of course
lettuce, shredded, with sandwiches or tacos, whatever
onions, raw, cooked, white, red, blue, other types, they don't taste the same but they're all good
celery, cut up into little bits, no problem, in stalks I hate to eat them because I can't chew them right, and they get stuck in my teeth
honeydew
blueberries (don't care if they are white inside or the other kind from the store, usually eat them with lots of sweetner anyways)
strawberries (good with sweetner, don't usually favor them with chocolate for some odd reason)
watermelon (really love the stuff, really hate the seeds, really hate even more cutting one open and finding space in the fridge)
some types of honey mustard - even though I typically hate mustard - some honey mustard I really like on chicken nuggets or cooked meat, sometimes the type used as salad dressing is tasty, it's not always easy to find the right brand
salad dressing, ranch and opaque milky stuff is typically good, hate the runny oily stuff although the dark hearted prince is the opposite
milk, used to skim milk, I'm also good with two percent, whole milk, chocolate, big milk drinker for a very long time including long before getting apartment, would go through it quickly and buy a couple of gallons with every trip to the grocery store (I'd walk over at least once or twice a week, twice is more common, more or less, and carry a couple of gallons back with other groceries [on foot, grocery store was right around corner])
soy milk, preferred vanilla and chocolate flavored (not into the diabetic-related stuff, that's different)
almond milk, preferred chocolate and vanilla flavored (not into the diabetic-related stuff, that's different)
fresh tomatoes, various sizes, hydroponic as well as the little ones, also grape tomatoes which are smaller, good for sandwiches and stuff in my experience
mushrooms, good in pizza, pasta sauce, sandwiches, etc., I would overcook them beyond what was needed after keeping them in my fridge, 'cuz I was paranoid about the dork "magic white frosting fairy" that would pay a visit over time (and other moldy stuff, had a story I told apartment maintenance guy about, old food in the fridge for way too long, that would glow funny colors and then I'd pull it out of the fridge and watch it fuckin' float in the air)
cheeses, american, cheddar (various), parmesan, provolone, swiss, mozzarella, feta, blue cheese (dressing), colby and colby-jack (somewhat, but I'll eat it with crackers or something), cottage cheese if mixed with something (iffy)
barbecue sauce, on breaded chicken or something, not sure what brands I've tried, I'd imagine it would be good on fries, I enjoy sweet and spicy together
jalapeño peppers, enjoyed eating them as they came with pizza from papa john's, would eat the whole thing without any sauce (seperate from the pizza), not bad
green peppers and red peppers in small pieces, small amounts, in a sub sandwich or pizza or something, larger amounts I don't like, although I suppose they would be okay with salad dressing
jelly, grape jelly, orange jelly with bits of orange peel, most fruit jellies more or less
tacos, ground beef, cheeses, lettuce, beans, chicken
meatloaf
ground beef like the kind used in tacos, usually good, if in doubt sauces are good
soy sauce
teriyaki sauce
chinese food, americanized
pizza
garlic salt, good on meat, chicken nuggets, other breaded chicken, potato products of all sorts, bread slices with butter, bread 
salt, table salt
sugar (white table sugar), brown sugar, good with all sorts of stuff, white sugar and other sweetners go good with milk sometimes, sugar goes good with butter and cinnamon on toasted bread, bakery, etc.
cinnamon, goes good with all sorts of stuff, bakery, breads, tried it with coffee and drinks, and other tasty stuff
corn, golden corn, white corn, corn on the cob, corn from the cob or from stalks, when fresh, is really good, can put up with canned corn of yellow kind or white kind or mixed white and yellow kind, also really enjoy cornbread over the years of so many sorts and variants, enjoy baking cornbread and sometimes corn muffins and using cornbread mix as a base for baking recipie experiments
bread based stuffing mix, would cook it and eat it out of a bowl, large amounts at a time (zarakite sized-portions) with lots of butter, milk, corn oil, and salt (zarakite amounts - note: not safe for humans, the portions of stuffing plus the added components it is cooked and/or seasoned with)
