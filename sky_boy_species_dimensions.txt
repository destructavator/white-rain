For the 3 (three) ages inbetween the oldest and the youngest [there are 5 (five) ages] you-can/one-should interpolate.

The tentative names for the five ages of all sky boys are:

infant [youngest/most-youthful]
child
pre-adolescent
adolescent
teenager [oldest/most-elderly]

'Adol' is an abbreviation/short-hand-form that can refer to 'adolescent'.
'Teen' is an abbreviation/short-hand-form that refers to 'teenager'.

'pint-sized' is a casual slang phrase for/sometimes-used-to-refer-to infants [and child-aged sky boys who need to cool it].

'rug-rat' is another such phrase that's the same thing, pretty much (?).

Teen-aged ['teenager-aged', if you're being technical, or a professor...] sky boys are the only ones that can wear a tiger's stripe, which is still optional and not all that common [varies].

These all assume that a sky boy is wearing his skin, and his skin is complete.  'wearing one's skin' in zarakite English languages means that a sky boy, according to what a man/historical-species-male-gender individual might say in English, 'has his head attached, and also has a neck attached underneath his head and to the top of his upper torso, like me'.  Sky boys would also say [interchangeably] that such a sky boy's skin 'has his head on'.  Note that sky boys refer to their bodies from the neck and below [as a human would observe] as their 'skin' and use the term 'body' to refer to a hybrid's anatomical parts/sections below their head [including their neck].  If a sky boy 'has an incomplete skin' then this means that a sky boy is in a temporary state where his skin has missing parts, and such missing parts are some combination of what are called 'detachables' and/versus what are called 'severed parts'.  A 'cap' as a sky boy calls it is also relevant terminology.  Sky boys also use the word 'skin' to refer to parts of their anatomy that do not include their body art, and such includes parts of their head as well as what is below it.  The word 'hide' also refers to the same thing except that such also includes all of their body art.  Regarding what is connected by/via tethering, such is currently undefined, as far as I know (?).

The youngest age sky boys are about 50 pounds, on average, heads and skins, not taking into account [sky boy natural] clothing.  At their oldest age, their average weight is about 100 pounds average, using the same criteria.  In kilograms, these numbers equate to approximately 22.67962 kg and 45.35924 kg, respectively.
