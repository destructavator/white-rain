Much talk from this forum, one of 1908 posts, including intellectual talks about - theoretical alien speicies, how a hypothetical sentient species evolves on various worlds and resulting characterisitcs, astronomy, serious-minded UFOs and exosolar life that has intelligent and educated non-conspiracy-theory scientific discussions as well as silly and shortsighted ignorant ultra-religious 'quick-and-snappy' paranoid rejection of alien life combined with tin foil hat psychotic talk and other discussions inbetween such, hard sci-fi and soft-sci-fi, intelligent talk as well as Chris-Sandusky-style-logic and what a 'wordoid' is, what a 'freshy' is [slang term, used in Antarctic historical species colonies where such live and such populations also go to [public] school and have local banks and convenience stores] etc, possible references to why some Antarctic human towns that have scientists seem to have an intelligent and clear-headed and non-infected understanding of global climate change and how dangerous funny-looking colored clouds in the sky are yet also 'mail-order' very large supplies of condoms for the six-month winters [believe it or not, there IS a casual, logical relationship between these two concepts, amid crackpot humor], and other stuff... -:

List of concepts:

Idea #0000:
	None of the dark-trio/dark-hearted have any natural innate zarakite-telekinesis as an ability of their species.  None of them ever did, and none of them ever will.  None of them were ever able to, and none of them ever will be able to.  None of them will ever be allowed or able to have such TK unless they become some type of species that is a creation of Zare [Zare of SkyCrown, divine being and magical sky dragon of planet-Earth-origin] which such Zare controls and is responsible, and is also able to control and manage responsibly and safely.

Idea #0001:
	All beings that are creations of Zare and Zare's offspring [direct and indirect], including creations from scratch as well as beings created out of existing living creatures that are some species to begin with, must live by and enforce and be bound by and ruled by and maintain zarakite values, both voluntarily and involuntarily, both willfully and instinctively, naturally and intuitively, and also like doing so, and also want to do so, and also like other creations of Zare to do the same, and also want other creations of Zare to do the same, and also enforce other creations of Zare to do the same, and also allow other creations of Zare to do the same, and also make able other creations of Zare to do the same, and also encourage other creations of Zare to do the same, and also discourage all creations of Zare from not doing the same.  These things apply life-long and permanantly sustained for the entire lifetimes of all creations of Zare, including well after death, and including into and beyond any reincarnation and the future lifetimes and future afterlives of all creations of Zare.  All of these statements in this idea/set-of-concepts is good according to zarakite values and lacking evil according to zarakite values and wanted and liked and desired by Zare of SkyCrowne and Proto.  Therefore, all of these things are naturally despised and hated by the dark-trio/dark-hearted who also want to - fight, suppress, thwart, ruin, sabotage, destroy, kill, prevent, delay, stall, diminish, reduce, belittle, disempower, trivialize, discredit, avoid, escape from, set up to fail, scapegoat, gaslight, slow down, bully, threaten, lie to, delude, lead astray, confuse, hate, vilify, demonize, make an enemy of, make everyone's enemy, curse, cripple, punish, outlaw, make illicit, condescend, scold, make look stupid, make appear to be dangerous to everyone, torture, traumitize, slay, kill, conquer, imprison, condemn, deprive, impovrish, refuse to love, pretend to love as one of many deceptions, be silent about as one of many deceptions, spy on, micromanage, over-investigate and be nosy into and violate the privacy of, overcontrol, bully, force, be rough on, set up to fail, sicken, want medicated, subject to evil medical, make unsustainable, decieve, lie to, be dishonest to, leave clueless, mind read, mind control, thought control, make evil, isolate, remove freedom from, subject to injustice, subject to pain, put through suffering, prevent having pleasure, prevent from being young, make unhealthy, make old, make disabled, make ugly and unattractive to the zarakite sex drive, enslave, refuse to cooperate with yet at times pretend otherwise - such aformentioned creations of Zare including Zare's species himself, as well as all reincarnations of such, always, for forever and a day.

Idea #0002:
	The dark trio and their values are not into hunting as any part of their lifestyles, and shun such, and leave such to those with zarakite values.  'Hunting' in this context refers to what Earth-origin carnivores do, for food and nutrition of their species, their individual selves as well as others of their kind.  Hunting for sport however, is another story, referring to going out and slaying another living creature who is innocent and never did anything to such an aforementioned 'hunter' to begin with, and isn't being hunted as prey for food or for use of their body parts [the anatomy of the prey] for any technology [fur and skin for clothing, bones to make into carving tools, etc].  Bullying an innocent who never bothered one's self to begin with is evil, plain and simple, easily irrefutable, according to zarakite values, and not among sky boy personalities found in dragon boys, and not tolerated in sky children, though such evil is found among dark hearted and dark trio, and not against dark-trio/dark-hearted values, and loved/favored/enjoyed by dark-trio/dark-hearted personalities while hated/despised/shunned among zarakite personalities, and also illicit and prohibited in SkyCrowne for dragon boys and sky children and many sky boy clans.  Dark clans of sky boys, if, have exceptions if Zare supports and allows such.  Note that 'dark' when referring to sky boy races is not intended to refer to physical appearance, but to character and to good versus evil in one's personality and nature.

Idea #0003:
	Paul S Reeves would never make a good musician.  He lacks the - creativity, personality, brain type, imagination, intellect - for such, as well as any natural potential to easily develop skills for playing musical instruments and songwriting.  He at one point tried to learn guitar, but flunked, and never could take it very far.  Also, if he were to hypothetically become a guitarist, which itself isn't likely, but irregardless if we were to look at an odd and illogical and improbable reality that can't be where he were a guitarist as a given concept for such a hypothetical reality, he would play acoustic guitar, and folk music, and play acoustic guitar at a campfire in late 20th century American human culture, and in past centuries play a mandolin or something in preceding centuries, in human cultures, and possibly be some sort of a bard as such.  By comparison, Proto and zarakite-dragon-likes-and-dislikes never would like being a middle-age-Euroupean bard in human culture, disliked bards in Dungeons and Dragons, disliked the character 'Iolo' in Ultima video games but was stuck with him of course in many adventures because of the videogame plotlines [Side note:  Someone or someones intelligently grouped together related concepts, to help, by making aformentioned 'Iolo' a guy into wielding a crossbow for a weapon, taking his wife along for the adbventure, and having an unpleasant dorky style of crackpot humor with the likeness of a combination of - Ron Marchie, Monty Python, Chris Sandusky - as well as an unsafe and evil schoolyard bully fuck-over personality that Ron Marchie had at times that would cross the line and really go below the belt, and also be wearing a beard all the time, as well as being an old man who is anything but young and is a dangerous old fool yet also a drunk who plays dumb all the time and isn't a good companion or ally but instead a dangerous loose cannon who isn't trustworthy and is always hiding something, and is playacting an alchohol-drinking and drug-using and law-breaking criminal-minded teenager who has anything but serious respect for authority and is also chauvenistic and sexist both beyond belief, never honest for the most part, and a coward who would run off at any time with his own agenda, someone who might or might not show up to be somewhat helpful but would irregardless not be trustworthy or dependable, or reliable, and would certainly run off and be a coward in the face of a simple stand-up swordfight, pretending to be a companion at other times.  Iolo, as a personality, as well as Ron Marchie, would be very difficult to motivate to get to do anything useful, and would be anything but reliable if one wants to ask him for something, as anything close to a 'friend'.  Such personalities also hate and despise following rules, and hate it when corruption is stamped out, and love it when plenty of corruption and rule-breaking and tomfoolery is rampant and everywhere.  Proto was also never really fond of crossbows of any sort in Dungeons and Dragons or most video games, and didn't like the ones in non-midieval-fantasy video games either, like Deus Ex Classic's mini-crossbow which Proto was never a fan of.  Proto also noticed during the 1990s that Paul S Reeves and using a crossbow of some kind seemed to go together in Proto's head quite easily, and also recalls when Paul Reeves would talk about repeating crossbow firing mechanisms and such, and it would be 'his type of thing' meaning a Paul Reeves thing, which of course one could also say is a Dark Hearted Prince type of thing.].  Regarding music, Paul S Reeves, over the years, has been into - Led Zepplin, Mick Jagger, jazz, older forms of music that precede heavy metal but were not what Proto would call heavy metal, Woodstock-era music, hippy-cultures of the nineteen-sixty-shit-something years, 'flower-power' crap, bell-bottoms, drugs and LSD and stoners freaking everywhere that one could smell downwind from the next continent over, bloody fuck, Industrial music including what unfortunately goes into Rammstien [fucker] but mostly a lot of industrial and techo stuff of various sorts although for some reason he didn't seem to get too much into KMFDM now that I think about it, huh...   That 'Destiny' thing is calling, according to guides.  'Grown up' he's been into touring with The Eagles as well as some hip-hop bands in Euroupe and Africa, and he's also toured with Justin Bieber.  He gets to know musicians closely and on a personal level, not just 'professional', and establish mundane pretense for being familiar with and being able to start a logical casual conversation about their personal lives the way a typical mundane ordinary human being would start a conversation.  He's had plenty of talks and started plenty of conversations about personal lives of aformentioned musicians, as well as AFI, Three Days Grace, Amy Lee from Evanescence whom he says presents herself as a 'goth chick' or something but really isn't such behind her public stage personality [I can't recall the fine points of the conversation off-hand], Justin Bieber whom he [Paul S Reeves] claims could get a lucrative post-celebrity career with cars/automobiles and stuff quite easily if only he were responsible and not a shit-head brat that is incompetant thanks to what the dark hearted prince quite likely turned Mr Beiber into behind the scenes.  Paul S Reeves also mentioned that Michael-Cummings/Spider of Powerman 5000 is 'fun on stage' yet Proto never asked for further details including whether or not he actually toured with them or not [I wouldn't jump to conclusions], and also worked with Chad from Nickelback and is aware of how he has sex with underage human girls from his audience and even bribes his own security manager to get away with such illegal acts at his concerts, yet for whatever reason it isn't like the police or the FBI in the USA [Nickelback is Canadian] can really do anything about it, given Paulists and their natures.  For the record, it hasn't been established whether or not such 'Chad' is a victim of Paulism or is himself/itself/herself [yikes] a Paulist.  Also for the record, there seems to be hints of an evil Josh Kohler in Chad, as well as Iolo, and some of the other problem personalities and identities and humans like them in some ways.  Proto never did actually get to know the literal, actual Mr Josh Kohler that well, both during and after school at the Lorain County vocational school, one of two where Proto studied auto mechanics, and had another Josh from the chosen list included from such who had blond hair and a blond beard and a girlfriend in class, as well as another original on the list of chosen, red-haired cute Chris with dreadlocks who was not part of the auto tech program but was in one of the side classes that included dumb stuff like how to plan a human American culture wedding as well as human species sex ed and human species sexually transmitted diseases where there were photos of penises and erections and related assingments and classroom discussions that students were supposed to get into to pass the class and for their grades [well, hey, Chris was hot and fun to jack off over, once getting home, even though Proto had to drop out of the class before the end of the school year for various reasons then study the same stuff again at Polaris Career Center in Berea.  Proto did pretty much the same thing with both Joshs and a few other students from actually both schools.  As a side note, the disabled kid groups were also present at both schools in different classes that haven't been mentioned, although such were not really attractive to the zarakite sex drive, as sky dragons and other dragon boys have sexual instincts that don't like disabled or downs-syndrome humans yet would like to put their penises into them to mutate them into what they find sexually attractive and fun to hang out with, and as such it's the anticipated aftermath that has any such sexual attraction, not how the damaged humans are to begin with of course.  Chris with his red dreadlocks and adorable face, not to mention the sounds of his vocal cords and such, were already attractive, and vanilla to begin with, with a lot of potential to be so much more, and still do considering he's on the list].

Idea #0004:
	TigerStone personalities are envisioned to be naturally and intuitively brash and anything but diplomatic about their sex drives, and never 'geek out' or laugh or crack up over any of their sex-drive-related behaviors or related conversation, but tend to make other teenage personalities of other faces laugh and crack up and such, and impress teenage boy personalities of both sky boy and human species quite naturally and very easily without really trying, while such TigerStone-faced boys naturally have a straight face and don't laugh from their hot-shot behaviors or their conversation, but do enjoy their personalities and also enjoy such effects it has on teenage boys of both species and their reactions to themselves.  These qualities are part of what make TigerStone boys very socially popular in-crowd boys among Teenage Target Culture high school populations of both human beings and sky boys, both inside and outside of school, and well desired by teenage boys of both types as friends.  Teenage and pre-teenage boys of both species view TigerStone faced sky boys as a lot of fun and really good friends for reasons that include these.  These qualities of TigerStone faced boys personalities, both personalities as well as sex drive, are precious and well-embraced by the zarakite sex drive as well as zarakite values and SkyCrowne as very good things that lack evil and are also anti-dark-trio and anti-dark-hearted.  Paul S Reeves as one example would scoff at such concepts promoted by sky boys, shaking his head and calling sky boys 'demented' and other things while being dismissive and walking away to have nothing to do with sky boys, and would rather cut off his penis quite happily and without having to really consider such than ever come close to having to live in a cuiture that accepts the sex drives and related culture that sky boys and zarakites have, and Paul S Reeves would never put up with any sex hormones that could lead to acceptance in such a culture in his body, and could never connect with such sexuality.  Such sky boy and zarakite sexuality is unreachable by psychics such as Paul S Reeves, untouchable, too far out of reach and too difficult for him to ever have any hope of claiming or infecting or corrupting such in any way, and he knows this, and he has known about this for quite some time, years, and has made his own preperations for such ahead of time, knowing that zarakites and their sky boys and their sex drives will happen in the future and will have to happen, and have an unbreakable destiny to overcome psychics such as himself as well as other dark-hearted/dark-trio, and that sky boy sex drives and their beyond-belief magical esoteric yet Earth-origin natures with a combination of - magic, teenage boy sex hormones that are beyond what the human species is capable of, Earth-origin carnivore instincts and natures, physical violence as a casual and everyday instinctive and intuitive and easy thing, eternal teenage boy youth that is far beyond what the human species is capable of, teenage boy youthful playfulness, all these things embraced and loved and desired life-long by those who have them as well as zarakite values, all these things so strong and mighty that in some sky boy clans they lead to some boys having them to the point they are actually dragons that at times have to put on their wings with feathered brilliant and magestic plumage that allow them to naturally and easily fly/actually-achieve-flight in casual and everyday ways [it isn't like they have to fill out some beaurocratic form in triplicate with some official in uniform or similar bullshit nonsense to sprout/grow their wings or anything, which is dark trio anyways, and public high school teachers as envisioned will sometimes be laid back and not care if such a dragon boy sits down in a classroom and still has his wings on once the bell rings and class begins, and probably just trusts his students to 'maintain their own personal anatomy, and if they have something biological happen, it's their problem' or whatever] - are an unbreakable and given set of honest and very real things in real that have to overcome such evils of the dark hearted and evils of the dark hearted trio in and accross all worlds and all realms where sky boys be, in any probable and any possible destiny that ever can be.

Idea #0005:
	Sky boy personalities typically don't think about being discreet regarding many sexual behaviors, and will masterbate as well as attach and detach their penises, and milk dragon boys, in plain sight in broad daylight in everyday indoor and outdoor public situations, including on a street corner as well as inside and outside a public shopping mall in public and common areas where people are walking back and forth, and can easily see and look at as well as touch and massage a sky boy's penile anatomy and other parts of his abodmen and skin and body parts both above and below the waistline, and underneath his clothing, casually, including while in the middle of a common everyday conversation that could be about trying to remember what to pick up from a grocery store later as well as what sports game might be on television later in the day.  Sky boys are like this without any need for courage, without trying to be this way deliberately, without thinking about privacy or being discreet, involuntarily and absent-mindedly, and naturally would have to most likely stop and deliberately think about things such as 'privacy' and 'being discreet' regarding having their sexual organs plainly visible as well as behaviors that involve using such body parts yet only when people such as humans would bring such things up in a conversation, and even still not fully understand such concepts from a human species point-of-view or what the dark queen used to call a 'perspective' [and is already losing any psychic claim to, in real life, irregardless of planning].  Such personalities and mindsets are not found naturally within the dark hearted and the dark hearted trio, except of course withing playacting and pretending which typically wouldn't be expected to be flawless as such culture is very unnatural for them [then again, they are very capable natural bullshitters, and dark-hearted/dark-trio are also very natural intuitive liars who by comparison find it difficult and unnatural and requiring stressful deliberate mental effort at times to be honest and straightforward in ways that don't involve deceptions or playing dumb, unlike sky boys who by comparison find it easy and natural and intuitive to be honest and straightforward and will even be ranchy and playful as such while having to be very deliberate and putting mental effort into deceptions and pranks and being sneaky].

Idea #0006:
	Sky boys, intutively and naturally, find it easy to be honest, and such doesn't tire them or drain them, and they have ways of creatively and intelligently being playful and funny, humorous and raunchy, when it comes to being honest, in ways that work with their popular-in-crowd-high-school teenage boy hormone-driven personalities, ways that by the way are different from bookworm and dork intellects which are totally different and unnatural as well as difficult when it comes to language and humor as well as honesty.  The dark trio, by comparison, don't find straightforward non-deceptive honesty to be easy or natural, and when actually being honest in such ways have to force such and the results range from being robot-like and psychopathic and heartless to being mean-spirited-and-threatening-and-dangerous to being neurotic and panic-like and frantic and having a nervous breakdown.

Idea #0007:
	When sky boys act in deception, which includes pranks, as well as evils according to zarakite values, they do so with physical actions and behaviors, and not social skills or language or conversation.  They don't think up lies or dishonest things to say very well, such is difficult for them, involves hesitation and needing time to think and in some cases stalling, and irregardless ends up with unconvincing and pathetic results that are worth making fun of, and their friends ripping on them over at later times.  Such involves all sky boys, all years of age, all ages, all clans, and TigerStone boys are no exception, even multi-headed zarakites.  This also affects hybrids, and hybirds that were recently human and are just getting used to being a hybrid and all the related fun and playfulness and such quickly find that they have to take the bad with the good, just like other things in real life, and find that they can't lie or bullshit very easily anything like what they grew up with.  Humans, as a species, are very dishonest and have to deliberately train themselves with voluntary effort and mental discipline to the point of being a damn religious monk at it to be honest and straightforward even half the time in a literal sense, and the dark trio have a massive extrapolation of such qualities, all three of them.  Dragon boys, both zarakites and half zarakites, have their magical ways to correct this, and their penises which sting and kill most creatures of the worlds in various places have special abilities and unique instincts with human species anatomy, and recreate humans [as evil as humans are, but dragon boys are of the same world of origin and do this anyways, screwball as it is] without killing them and typically without taking their lives away as hybrids that later develop eventually into sky boys, and take away humans' ability to be 'human' about deceptions and lies and honesty, even human teenagers of the most uncouth variety which find that they are even more uncouth and far more playful and have a lot more fun with themselves and their friends than they were before being stung by a dragon boy, and make friends far more easily afterwards of both sky boys and human beings.  Parents of humans that become hybrids do indeed have to put up with difficulties surrounding their children's change in anatomy and habits and how they take care of themselves, as well as their child's requirements for diet and sex, along with regular contact including social and recreational with sky boys, but on the other hand find that their child is naturally honest and doesn't play dumb convincingly without realizing that they are doing so when it comes to TALKING TO THEM in any verbal conversation including very casual ones.  Such parents also find that their sky boy friends are surprisingly honest and easy to ask questions of and get an answer from without any question as to whether or not they are being honest or not.  If a sky boy is being playful during a conversation, it shows, and it's always temporary.  Sky boys who tell lies playfully only do so for a short-lived time, then drop the 'gag' or deception rather quickly only a short while later, typically a few moments, and a few hours long is quite rare.  Sky boys who are laughing playfully and even goofing off as rowdy teenage boys will still pause if they feel someone else 'doesn't get it' and ask a human 'You do realize I was just joking, right?  You sure?' if they feel a human is clueless or doesn't understand, regardless of the human's personality, regardless of the human's gender.  Sky boys are very socially intelligent, and can actually be very cautious and careful around adult female personalities that are non-hostile, TigerStone faced boys especially, who in such cases tend to be more quiet, carefully holding back their teenage boy rowdy nature with effort during a conversation to 'make do' with what they are realistically capable of to come close to being respectful [which they know isn't much].  Note that when a sky boy does do something deceptive, they typically leave conversation out of it, and will hide or sneak something as well as themselves around, and try to do so without such being noticed, quickly and intuitively, risk-taking and without stopping to think for very long, and naturally practice such skills during their lifetimes to sneak up on prey when hunting in any wilderness as well as enemies on any battlefield to kill with a sword or gun or penis.  Once conversation gets involved, such deceptions as well as high school pranks and tomfoolery quickly fall apart and at that point a sky boy typically abondons such a deception and runs off if they have to but usually fights courageously by nature as a warrior and swordsman and gunfighter and natural predator that moves fast and stikes quickly and intensely including quickly moving without hesitation from one quick and intense attack to another [a sky boy who gets his sword stuck in something doesn't struggle with it for long, often not at all, and will at times not bother to free a sword that might be stuck but might not be in the interest of moving quickly and attacking to kill via some other weapon or method].  Note that sky boys don't always use deceptions or stealth to figtht enemies as well as to hunt prey.  If a sky boy does use stealh or being tricky, he will typically only use it at the beginning of a fight or battle, and throughout the fight not favor hiding or even taking cover, and prefer to close in on an enemy without stealth alwyas being important and kill so quick and fast and ferociously that it doesn't really matter anyways, though such varies.
	Note that this idea [set of concepts] is likely but not fully certain.  Such is still cloudy.

Idea #0008:
	The dark hearted trio love to be deceptive and secretive, and in doing so treat other species as well as in at least some cases their own kind as well, the same way they treat humans, condescending, manipulative and dishonest to, while being guarded and tight-lipped and secretive the whole time, long term for decades and centuries and millenia and beyond.  Note that he dark hearted trio are not the same as their vessels, and are not of planet Earth in origin.  Sally Lynn Reeves is actually innocent while being a life-long vessel of a hostile evil possessor, for one example.  She actually doesn't necessarily deserve to die or be hurt, or even suffer, and I've noticed over the years that there is serious backlash against harming her but not her evil [possessor], perhaps because of what's involved and what would be involved with stopping her evil that is in her.  One can extrapolate in looking at the other two, although the other two are not the same, and the overall situation certainly isn't black-and-white.  In the interest of not 'treading water' in conversation and saying useless redundant statements like a damn politician on television on planet Earth who simply likes to hear themself speak, the dark hearted queen is someone who has a natural innate biological ability to easily mind control other beings and make other beings of any species think what she wants them to, naturally and easily as well as casually, and by comparison the dark hearted king is one who wields thought control technologies in a world-wide network of machines and electronics and satellites that is wireless and cordless and works many hundereds of miles away on planet Earth, and the dark hearted prince has much of the same abilities, yet also affects human beings in-person that are within line-of-sight on planet Earth and also make lasting permanent changes that corrupt and sicken and make evil all his victims, making them stupid as well as gullible and psychiatric as well as rule-breaking in some cases.  Victims of his have mental health issues, and at times develop rule-breaking and dishonest qualities.  These last concepts regarding the dark hearted prince specifically are quite cloudy and are not definitively established in a factual sense, and what Proto would call 'suggestive' and 'unconfirmed' as well as 'suspected' and nothing more.  Such is weak, vague, and if such things were to commonly be acceptable in a human USA court of law [which they wouldn't, but, anyways], Proto would think that such information doesn't have much backing, and wouldn't be worth it to bring up with any judge or jury, and would be far from what would be considered 'proof' that any such court would take, but then again I'm not a lawyer or legal expert, and for all I know the feds might have something weird up their sleeve, and probably do, considering that they are already involved and doing stuff that actually is going somewhere, and have for some time, and I've noticed quite a bit of such which they've wanted me to witness and remember.  [They don't do this with humans.]

Idea #0009:
	Listening to music that Proto likes listening to while working on stuff is something Proto is quite used to and has established over a number of years of time including going back to before he lived in his own apartment in Victoria Plaza Apartments in the City Of North Olmsted, and as far back as living in the same house/home/household/residence as Sally Lynn Reeves and Martin Eric Reeves and Paul Samuel Reeves.  Proto got used to this type of thing as a habit and enjoys such, and this includes music videos and concerts as well as songs that he likes to listen to.  This has worked with Proto for schoolwork, including college and high school, and other schools, and police work when he would work in the office and he wasn't doing foot patrol.  [It was either that or watching Judge Judy on television, and the Sergeant hated seeing Judge Judy on the TV in the office, so we didn't have the TV on too often, and instead for the most part had a bunch of screens that would be hooked up to the security cameras on campus and controls for such.  Such security cameras were in fact mentioned in multiple discussions with the earliest guides in Proto's head, when Proto was attempting to define and describe the concepts of 'oversight' and what an 'overseer' is and how 'supervision' works and how such prevents what is called 'corruption' which Proto tried many times in futility to spell one letter at a time or even just the last several letters, but often couldn't, as the flummoxing [sometimes inappropriately called 'flubbery' by mistake and going back to an unrealated misnomer of a different type and different fucked-up meaning from a Kieth Coogan film about a babysitter, and a facial expression and emotional reaction Kieth Coogan had in one part of the film, another story...] was simply too much and too overpowering.  The police department Proto worked at and his Sergeant and the brass had the right idea, and did the 'oversight' and 'overseer' thing properly to prevent corruption, meaning they did the right thing, and they did it a simple yet effective way that works for humans and requires no esoterics and just works, with simple mundane tried and true methods well proven that humans could have used to save their sorry asses a long time ago in the Cleveland area and is something FBI but even common police officers can do anytime.  What they did was simply have a non-stop video feed from the security cameras at the office go to not only the office where Proto worked but also copy the live signal and send the copy of the video feed all the way down to Metro dispatch in downtown Cleveland, where the cops in the office at Parma\Western campus station 200 didn't ever know who was watching that video feed at any time down in the Metro dispatch office, and just knew that someone could be watching what they were making the cameras look at at any given/hypothetical time, so if they knew what was good for them they would be the little stupid shithead that shouldn't type of patrolman or student assistant and make one of the cameras on campus stare down some college girl's clothing to put her boobs up on display in the office for anyone's jollies.  There was a similar thing about the police radios and the radio extenders they had access to at Parma West.  One of the first things Proto learned was to absolutely never curse or swear on his police radio, and the department had the same radio traffic for western campus as well as eastern campus and metro campus including dispatch.  As such, the chief, The Boss [yes, it gets captilized] could be listening in on radio traffic at any given moment, and frequently did, as such was his job, and Proto's boss's boss the department Commander as well as other supervisors from downtown did indeed use the radios from time to time, something Proto was quite familiar with, and was actually supposed to be familiar with, as part of his job, as it was not unheard of for Proto to hear a ten-code on his radio and be expected to head back to the office and see the Commander and sometimes other supervisors he answered to during his job experience at the college.  The point I'm getting to is that with this 'supervision thing' it prevents corruption because screwballs that might hypothetically jerk each other off on the radios while on the job get caught, and end up in a special meeting with their boss, his face bright red to contrast his gold badge, and leave the meeting without a uniform, like, uh, ever again.]  These concepts of supervision from overseers and what 'oversight' means in Zarakite are deterrents that motivate humans in these types of situations, and make humans decide not to be corrupt but instead follow orders and not do evil criminal things that betray their superiors, and also lead to humans not playing-dumb/playing-games about such things that are too dangerous and anything but professional, a type of criminal unprofessional that is too dangerous to ever be hired to work in soldier class to begin with and would never graduate high school either and also be in jail instead and for well justified reasons, not to mention never qualifiying for any security credentials or being allowed to have any authority.  Proto grew up with and has witnessed first-hand examples of this type of oversight and supervision, and how it just works to prevent corruption and chaos and anarchy, and instead lead to proper teamwork and individuals surviving a disaster and having a right to survive in the first place, and such works with simple mundane practical obvious common sense logic, no esoterics required, and in departments and offices and jobs where various individuals work, as well as common public school classrooms, such is something human beings and common human personalities from at least Teenage Target Culture are quite used to and accepting of and grew up with and don't find stressful and find easy to live with and be used to and don't find such maddening or leading to anger or hot tempers or temper tantrums or being upset or crabby or irritable and such people just get work done and don't find it that difficult.  As for personalities that are evil and FUBAR (Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition) and are hopeless and beyond sanity and beyond help and have no reliable chance of ever coming back, and are way too sensitive and uptight about such overseers and supervision, that's another story.  Those types include overzealous schoolyard psychopathic bullies and very dangerous individuals that simply should never be trusted or allowed to be empowered, and such includes both the dark hearted and dark hearted trio, and humans that follow in their footsteps, any way one slices it.  No administration, no future administration, no survivors of any disaster either, would ever want or trust such hostile individuals, or allow anyone else to ever let them in the door, there's no way around it.  Further, the violent quick tempers and violent anger seen among many aforementioned humans that really fucked up is a one-for-one match with a hair-trigger violent super-sensitive temper Proto witnessed in both Martin Eric Reeves and Sally Lynn Reeves over the decades [decades are tens of years, as some guides are still asking dumb questions and mocking such things, even now], very mundane and very dangerous hair-trigger/super-sensitive violent tempers by human species standards and very dangerous and destructive personalities that smash and break things in temper tantrums even as adults no matter how old and prone to such dangerous and uncontrolled and random physical violence lacking safety and lacking controls at home and at any workplace, such is well established in those two of the dark trio at least, with such individuals having well established pretense for having such personality characteristics and being 'typical' and 'in character' to behave in such ways, and what Proto has plenty of first-hand connection points to from what he has witnessed.  Also note that Proto has likewise first-hand experience witnessing and having connection points to Paul S Reeves also having temper tantrums of what was described to Proto by a college psychology instructor and counselor and licensed professional as 'schizoid' personality characteristics, relevant to how Paul S Reeves over the years would seem to keep emotions bottled up and then whine and wimper and act very childish and have weird and unpredictable outbursts when getting emotionally upset and such happening with very immature and tiny-kid childish behavior that toddler-age humans typically have when very upset before they grow up and learn how to handle very simple stressful things in daily life.  Paul S Reeves does this from time to time, and does this even in recent years when things don't seem to go his way, and he is very uptight as such, and he was this way long before high school and also in recent years even past his 30s and into early 40s, and in-between with consistency, all-inclusive, with well-established pretense for such emotions and such behaviors of what seems to Proto to be non-esoteric.  One should keep in mind that Proto has no natural way that he has ever been aware of to detect or sense how or when any of the dark trio ever do anything psychic or esoteric, he is stuck with mundane physical senses of sight from his eyeballs and hearing from his ears, and relies on signs and clues from such mundane senses exclusively his entire life of a little over four decades because those types of physical non-psychic and mundane senses are what he is familiar with and is used to having the whole time over the years and absolutely nothing else, and so those types of non-psychic mundane and ordinary phsycial senses are what he relies on, tried and true, and depends on, and considers reliable and trustworthy, and he never developed any sort of ESP or psychic senses, and never can anyways [he found out he's not allowed to, no universe would allow such, no universe would ever allow Proto to be made able to do such, and zarakite values also forbid and prohibit such for forever and a day, and these restrictions/limitations were also true to begin with before Proto was born, out of mandated destiny].  One could also say that Proto is blind to what is psychic as well as telepathic, and indeed Proto wouldn't know what to look for if someone were psychic and were doing something dangerous with psychic methods that left no side effects or tell-tale signs that were physical and mundane and left real life physical evidence behind that Proto would recognize and identify, much like an ordinary common human being with typical common and usual sense of vision and sense of hearing in just the same ways.  What appears to Proto to be a human could actually be something else, and Proto wouldn't know.  Proto also can't tell if someone is a vessel or not, it's not like he was ever a mind reader or anything, or a telepath.  The only reason Proto is still experiencing telepathy is because someone else is using their own telepathic methods in Proto's head, and not because of any ability Proto doesn't have.  Proto also can't mind read, and never could.  As for discrepencies between Proto and human beings, as well as human vessels, Proto is not a human being but is another species which unfortunately is too easily mistaken for a human being by human eyes and human ears, and has a very different brain than a human being, and as such has biological incompatibilities with what does and doesn't work with human brain cells and such.  Proto's diet by his preference is also not normal by human being standards and is actually toxic and lethal to a human being, which is normal for Proto.  One can also note that if Proto is forced to eat like a human being because of what is available, such doesn't turn Proto into a human, never would, and doesn't make his brain or personality like that of a human, and won't make anything that is meant for human brain tissues compatible with Proto, it just doesn't work, and just wouldn't ever work, plain and simple by easy practical common sense and mundane physical non-esoteric common logic that isn't top secret or anything.  One could note that if Proto has to eat like a human being does, especially all day long, such is unpleasant and difficult for Proto, Proto hates that, it violates his pleasure, and such logically provokes Proto into being crabby, fussy, upset, and difficult, even angry, and such is well justified on Proto's part for being mistreated and bullied as such.  Perhaps one should look at how Proto has never, ever bullied or pressured any human being, ever, anywhere, into eating a diet like his, and isn't a heartless bastard like Martin Eric Reeves that would turn the tables on someone and say 'Well, why don't YOU eat MY diet [and keel over and die]?' and actually hurt another species like that.  Proto didn't do such things to anyone during junior high school or grade school either, and of course he wouldn't, duh, a little thing called 'compassion' related to 'having a heart' and not being some callous psychopathic evil fuck and other concepts that are way outside the understanding of certain dark hearted and very dangerous humans who would have no understandings of such concepts and would actually have to consult a dictionary or a damn computer or translator or simlar reference over the matter, yikes.  [The dark hearted trio, for decades, and far longer with other vessels and other lives, one way or another, also have such evil personalities incapable of love and incapable of understanding compassion and incapable of beginning to understand having an open mind, and have had such invariably over such millenia, zealot and fanatical, absolutionist as such, with no hope of ever changing in such ways, and a long established pretense of such things, but also a long established pretense and history of pretending to not have such qualities, faking it and also obfuscating records and paper trails that affect a combination of physical evidence not limited to written/inscribed/carved/recorded logs/records/documents/media but also the minds and memories short term and long term of various sentient beings including human beings which are by comparison actually very easy to mind control and brainwash and as such very dangerous to empower becuase of how they could then easily become compromised which in fact is something the dark trio demonstrated by fuck-over example with the human species over time, well established and with pretense, and for how many millenia and perhaps millions of years of such being performed and demonstrated and established, Proto just doesn't know.  Not to be an ass, but this itself does establish and conclude how such evil methods of educating one about good and evil in at least one multiverse, as well as how real life works, really is dark hearted trio and very evil, and very infectious and infected and claimed by evil as such.  After all, when such so-called 'educational' methods are employed/used, look at how much dark hearted trio and related evil spreads around, attracted like a magnet, infecting many left and right and requiring intervention of more than one world out of necessity to fight back and do damage control, look at how much damage is done and how many suffer, and many are stuck with increasingly unpleasant and loathsome last-resort options they would rather die than accept, look at the consistency with such, long term, and what seems to be the general overall long-term trend...  Need I say that such an evil 'education-by-fuck-over' style of demonstrating and teaching someone stinks like fuck of Paul S Reeves and his personality, and in many ways Sally L Reeves and perhaps Martin Eric Reeves as well, the personalities that they seem to have, that they were programmed and mind controlled and possessed into having?]. 

Idea #0010:
	First person vs third person, Proto and 'I' and credibility and jackasses who don't believe what's so damn obvious they need more than a kick in the head

Idea #0011:
	Paul Samuel Reeves and his martial arts trophies, and how he and Proto both studied martial arts, and Proto had lived in both bedrooms, and when
	Also how Paul S Reeves collected many trophies over the years, and how Proto never collected any and never went to any tournaments even when such was offered because he never wanted any and knew he could get some if he wanted to and he had plenty of opportunities to do so, yet serious-mindedly honestly didn't want to, and had a different personality than Paul S Reeves, and wanted to study martial arts for very different reasons than Paul S Reeves, such differences were always there between Proto and Paul, hint hint

Idea #0012:
	For one who is a hybird or sky boy of any sort, including any sky child, sucking on a penis of any dragon sky boy [all zarakites and all half zarakites, any face, any tribe, any family] while it is connected to the dragon boy, is an act of love and compassion of the dragon boy for hybrid or boy sucking on the dragon or half dragon.  Such an act completely lacks anything condescending in nature, and also completely lacks any act of bullying or anyone having power over another in any direction, and is not an act of anyone bullying anyone at all whatsoever in any direction [for the dragon boy as well as whomever is sucking on their penis and making the dragon boy ejaculate natural dragon milk or dragon candy], and excessive acts of this type are actually coddling and pampering from the dragon boy and to whomever is sucking on their penis and therefore drinking their milk or candy, and this all applies in a natural and instinctive sense to what it feels like for both the dragon boy as well as whomever is sucking on them, and is also how their culture sees it, both the collective sky boy culture of all clans as well as that of individual clans of sky boys such as the kahjeet and cents as well as all dragon boys and sky children, etc.  Being raunchy and any teenage humor is not required or necessarily part of milking a dragon boy or sucking candy out of them, at least not in itself, and if such an attitude or conversation is present, it is coincidence, as milking a zarakite as well as a zarakite is actually a serious-minded natural practice that feeds and nourishes all sky boys naturally and biologically, and replenishes their magic, and is part of normal healthy diet and nutrition for all sky boys, is very common, and is actually required for hybrids while they are developing and growing and internally shape-shifiting into what will eventually be some sort of sky boy as a species.  No sky boys can breastfeed, their nipples are incapable of generating milk and are incapable of growing any such tissues, not even if exposed in any unnatural sense to hormones, unlike humans, and such applies to both natural hormones as well as those that are from elective surgery and cosmetic surgery and voluntary medical stuff that some humans do to themselves with sex change operations and crap.  Note that zarakites and actually all sky boys including sky children don't have human blood or human hormones or human enzymes etc in their bodies and anatomy anyways, both sex hormones and otherwise, and instead have their own, relevant to their species.  Such is one reason of many that no sky boys have testicles at the base of their penises or in their groin as part of their anatomy, they don't need them, they have their sex hormones generated and used via other means which work for their species, and wouldn't use or need human sex hormones for that which lack compatibility.  If one were to hand any sky boy a pair of human testicles, they wouldn't want such surgically attached to themselves for normal sex or hormones or anything, sky boys are male gender without testicles and are male gender for other reasons as they are not human beings but are another species, thank you, and a sky boy could however eat a pair of human testicles as a snack, as they are natural carnivores and eat animal body parts of Earth-origin [sky boys are from planet Earth too, or at least Earth-origin, just like humans], and sky boys eat a carnivore diet that does not naturally involve cooking such meat, and instead typically and instinctively eat such meat and animal parts like a cougar or wolf or bengal tiger would.  Swallowing bits of fur and other internal organs is normal and common for sky boys.  Regarding a zarakite's milk and candy, as well as that of half zarakites, dragon sky boys do not have any prostate or sperm or urine in anything that comes out of their penises, or anything that smells like such things which by the way they would find the smell and taste of quite disgusting and refuse to voluntarily ingest just like a human being common boy would.  Such would make them gag and throw up, although they wouldn't voluntarily swallow that shit to begin with, and sky boys are not afraid or hesistant in a general sense to back that up with physical violence.  The zarakites in particular, with the most dragon to their natures, have natural fangs and claws, and are used to casually killing large animals and other dangerous predators that stand larger than themselves as a casual thing in the middle of conversation while hanging out with friends and not really be inclined to change the subject to anything to do with their prey, other than, 'Huh?  Oh, would you like a peice?' as in 'are you also hungry?' and offer you a chunk of the carcass still fresh and dripping with blood as a snack that they are sharing with their friend, much like a human at a fast food place would casually share a few of their french fries, but not want the discussion to really turn into a lot of talk about the french fries or where the french fries came from or what he did to get those french fries.  Milking a dragon boy actually has the same casual nature to it, the same as enjoying a specific piece of fast food.  With candy, the same thing applies.  Granted, when a dragon boy is ejaculating because someone is milking him, he can't speak, and just has his mouth hanging open a little, and can't make most typical facial expressions, though he can still turn his eyes and look at whatever he wants, because of involountary reflexes and instincts that come with ejaculating [applies to milk, candy, actually all forms of ejaculating, including when a zarakite extends his penis underneath and around nearby objects and terrain for what could be longer than the length of a small human technology parking lot and then degenerates his whole body, head and skin, to squirt himself through his penis and regenerate himself at the other end, this set of relexes of the face and inablitiy to speak also come with masterbation and sex during any climax/session but not right before and after and between such].  Note that when sky boys are ejaculating and have this type of thing going on with their face and facial expressions and lack of ability to speak, they often do these things casually while in the middle of a conversation, including in public, in, say, a fast food restuarant, both indoors and outside, and such is incapable of generating embarassment or shame for them, becuase of their personalities, very different than other species, such as human beings.  When they are ejaculating for any reason and can't talk, its like when a human at a fast food place takes a bit to eat out of a burger or is drinking some milkshake or soda with a straw, and chewing and swallowing, and can't talk at the same time of course but is still in a general sense part of the conversation with others they are sitting or standing with, still listening, and still ready to talk both before and after doing such things, just like a sky boy before and after and between ejaculating, just as casual, and not something that they or other sky boys would make a big deal of or even make-conversation-of/change-the-topic-of-their-conversation-with-their-friends-to-talk-about.  Not even dork persoanlilities would really do that.  Note that regarding giving-milk/having-a-sky-boy-milk-one's-self, a dragon boy isn't being condescending-to/exerting-power-or-social-dominance-or-authority-over/oppressing/bullying anyone that is milking them, and in fact is in some cases being submissive and giving in during some potential situations if they are letting a hybrid or sky boy milk them excessively and more than what they were planning to allow initially, and actually pampering and spoiling a sky boy that they allow to suck a lot of milk and candy and attention out of a dragon sky boy.  These types of understandings and ways of looking at these things are mutual, instinctive, cultural, normal, and universal among all sky boys, all clans, including dragon boys milking other dragon boys, as well as when a dragon boy hasn't had anyone milk himself in some time, and has cravings, and is accumulating a 'boner' so to speak for having someone milk him, and detaches his head and sips some milk from his own skin's penis then reattaches it to temporarily stave-off/satisfy/hold-off on his cravings until he can find someone who wants to milk a dragon sky boy [these things happen on a daily basis, regular and throughout the day, where they come and go, for all zarakites and all half zarakites of the all of the zarakite tribes, and is part of their natures to care for and protect and feed other sky boy clans and the populations as well as what humanity evolves and turns into, part of their role and function in destiny among Earth-origin life, and evolution of sentient species of themselves and humans on planet Earth, and how and why these zarakite dragons and their tribes come about in planet Earth's history and future, and why they evolve, as well as their natures as natural warlords and swordfighters and soldiers of various sorts, as well as eternally youthful teenagers who can be raunchy and playful at times, and never 'grow-up' into anything a human being relates to, more or less, yet still have easy and natural ways of having a functional and healthy and unified utopia of culture and civilization that lacks anarchy and lacks rebellions and lacks division as a whole species of all clans].  Zarakite milk and half zarakite milk is always good-tasting to the taste of all hybrids and all sky boys of all clans, delicious and healthy, and the same goes for candy [sucked out of a 'trophy' as sky boys call it, when a zarakite or half zarakite has a 'deflated' penis, long empty flesh that a human would call 'skin', like a common rubber balloon that was inflated and then deflated after a long time and doesn't shrink again with any elasticity, except for the penis tip which still has normal shape to it, yet still living tissue with any blood and nerves and any sense of touch and fell it normally would have].  All sky boys and all hybrids have natural taste buds and sense of taste which yield pleasure from drinking and eating dragon boy milk and candy of all kinds, although the flavors of the milk and candy from such dragon boys isn't the same, and varies not by identity but by what face the dragon boy has from the Book Of Faces.  Dragon boy milk and candy has a good amount of nutrients in it, enough that hybirds and sky boys of all types can live indefinitely off of such when combined with sexual intercourse from a sky boy on a regular basis as needed, although all sky boys have instincts and cravings to occasionally enjoy hunting Earth-origin animal life as carnivores, but even more so have instincts and cravings where they regularly eat various sky boy culinary cuisines, what appear to be to human eyes to be - human pizzas, human fast food, human junk food, food from human restuarants of all kinds and not just fast food, human food from various human grocery stores - but is actually not the same, and is in fact made from various sky boy eggs, dragon milk and candy of various flavors, sky boy penises, water - and sky boy cooks and chefs, and has a lot of caffiene in it, and not the same nutrition or nutrients as human food that looks the same.  Such sky boy food, if uneaten, eventually rots and decomposes, and is biodegradable along with human waste and common vermin from planet Earth just the same as other life from planet Earth, including individual nutrients, bacteria, enzymes, microorganisms, protiens, etc.  As for humans eating sky boy food, it has a comparable taste, but the nutrition isn't the same.

Idea #0013:
	Human lawmakers, right at the start of the Transition Period in the history of the human species and planet Earth, are definetly going to have a shit fit any way one slices it [no matter how one looks at it] over getting to know the magic sky dragons called zarakites and their tribes, as well as how to get the public [the masses] acclimated to and used to sky boys of various clans as well as the public [human beings] used to and accepting dragon sky boys making humans into hybrids, to save their lives and take care of them for all time and all generations, though it will still work, it will still happen, and without massive chaos, and without mass panic, and without anarchy, and it won't be like there will be nuclear war or anything, geez, human beings will still find that they are okay accepting sky boys and getting to know them and getting to become them, including integrating them into public schools and such along with human students, and it will actually work and humans will actually find they like it and are comfortable with it, unlike racial diversity programs of trying to integrate inner-city ghetto human children with human children from the suburbs which by comparison have been an abysmal failure and lead to a lot more than fights in public school hallways and parking lots and other hardships and crap that won't happen with sky boys and zarakites and humans becoming hybrids and then sky children.  These things are forseen to be, for at least North America, and a part of the past history that will be in public school history books in Future Focus of Divination, also known as Future Focus of Destiny.

Idea #0014:
	Hybrid heads are durable, and while not necessarily as durable as a sky child's head, tolerate and do just fine with being thrown and bounced around like a basketball and soccar ball and such, just like the heads of all sky boys, and as such are at least up to par with sky boy heads in that respect.

Idea #0015:
	Humans can sometimes eat at least some sky boy food, and although the taste is much like what it appears to be to human eyes but lacking annoying flaws and imperfections found in human versions of such, the nutrition isn't the same, and sky boy food also has a lot of caffiene in it.  Wild animals on planet Earth, if they get into food that is left out someplace in outdoor areas, they get into sky boy food in just the same way they would with human foods.  Such wild animals can get sick from such, much like how they can get unhealthy from human foods as well.  Both sky boys and humans are from the same planet.

Idea #0016:
	'Brian Zanger' might actually be Blond-haired Brian's real name, as a human, before being reincarnated as a half dragon sky boy and shapeshifter, thanks to magical zarakite dragons and elves and friends who were so nice to go out of their way and step in and help, and we'll find out how his penis tastes later [don't forget how hot his head looks, blue and blond hair on the same head, long and flowing, and a cute face, one that belongs to a very quick and cool intelligent guy that knows all to well how to put a stop to when HE thinks you've had enough of him, thank you very much].

Idea #0017:
	Dragon boys are more socially intelligent [versus 'bookworm smarts' or 'walking calculator' that puts a Cray supercomputer to shame or whatever] than all other clans of sky boys, and zarakites are better than all half zarakites in the same way.  Tiger Dragons [zarakites with five heads] are more socially intelligent than four-headed zarakites, which are better than two-headed zarakites, which are superior to single head zarakites, in social intelligence and easily being popular to hang out with both in and out of school, as well as the best warriors and soldier class, which are also the best at quickly coming up with pranks and creative booby-traps and strategy [not just attaching an arm and the right type of glove with it to some piece of furniture or lamp post or parked human motorcycle's engine whatever], and the best hunters, and make the best smartass remarks and sarcasm, even without more than one torso, or wearing at least two torsos tops.  Such hasn't a thing to do with their face.

Idea #0018:
	I understand object-oriented programming, and so do at least one of each of my exosolar allies by species.

Idea #0019:
	I came up with the idea of making a whole pot of tea with only a single tea bag and a coffee machine, by ripping open the tea bag and putting the contents into the coffee machone with a standard coffee filter, and filling up the machine with plain tap water for a whole 16 (sixteen) cups.  The resulting tea always comes out thick, anything but watery, and very strong.  This technique is a lot better than putting a mug with water into a microwave and having to leave a tea bag in the mug for an hour, and only getting one mug out of it.  This works with any common brand of tea, any type, black tea, green tea, etc, any typical cheap stuff.  [I never tried it with any fancy custom-order tea that one sends out a butler in a limo to get or anything, just regular TEA from the grocery store right down the street for a buck or two, ANY store.]  Cuultyr told people around the apartment building where he lived [19 (nineteen) floors] and at school about this technique, as it wasn't a big secret or anything, and was intended to be common everyday knowledge [for the layperson] that I wasn't trying to be famous for, and I honestly didn't care if anyone knew that I came up with it or not.  Over time, both Mark Schmitz and Ron Marchie [who both lived in the apartment building] pretended that they came up with the idea themselves [individually, nothing to do with each other] and no one else, in different independent conversations that had nothing to do with each other.

Idea #0020:
	Like idea #0019, but involving Dan Erliwine the celebrity guitar tech and the phrase 'If it's too sharp, it's too short' regarding intonation, except that in his book Dan did the right thing and explained quite clearly [and verbosely, not to mention 'victimist' style] that he didn't come up with the idea and he also did not know who did.

Idea #0021:
	Both idea #0019 and idea #0020 are true and honest and also happened in real life.  Both happened in the real life I live in, the same that I was born in and the same that has the keyboard I'm currently typing this with.  I want food that brings me pleasure such as caffiene and tomato and mayo and breaded boneless chicken and salt to provide further honest and understandable answers and complete information that lack deceptions and removes misunderstandings and overcomes all deceptions that are evil according to zarakite values [which includes a certain immortal's wants and the same immortal's wishes and the same immortal's imaginations over his entire lifetime].

Idea #0022:
	During the years I lived in an apartment in North Olmsted, I purchased and ordered a lot of food, and ate it while it was fresh, and often threw out old food that was in many cases still good.

Idea #0023:
	This universe at least, along with planet Earth of course, will never accept any female sky boys of any clan, of any type, of any number of heads, any number of ab blocks, any lack of ab blocks, with wings and without wings, any way one slices it, and such is irrefutable and absolute of course, and of course accepted and now backed by zarakite values as well as Zarakite Law which must irrevocably do so, enforced by exosolar allies of more than one world and more than one galaxy and allies of Zare of SkyCrowne, in absolute and final and of course not open for further reconsideration of course, 'nuff said.

Idea #0024:
	Proto ate a lot of toothpaste when he was little, and never spat it out when brushing his teeth.  He never liked spitting frothy toothpaste or anylike like it, or foaming at the mouth like that, or spitting in general.  He would always swallow it.  He did this over the years while living in Virginia and before-hand, and also afterwards in Ohio, living around the Great Lakes.  Eventually he found his teeth did better when he stopped brushing altogether, and he didn't develop cavities or rotting teeth, and found that not brushing and not using toothpaste seemed to be the right thing to do, at least for himself.  The Dark Prince Paul Reeves spoke of bacteria and microorganisms or something that would grow and live on the surface of teeth, so that brushing and toothpaste would both never be needed for healthy teeth, and he had his own ideas he spoke of for marketing and patenting something of the sort, and making it government technology, issued to the masses, and subject to regulations, and probably an inferior version for most while a superior restricted version for the elite and ruling class as well as soldiers and military etc.  Paul Reeves had a mindset and personality Proto witnessed and listened to over the years where Paul would want to take something natural and make it into some government and military product, Paul would do something like that. 

Idea #0025:
	Sally Lynn Reeves is a human and is the 'Common Vessel' for a Sallyist called 'The Dark Hearted Queen' as well as 'The Dark Queen', and this Sallyist is a possessor (being who possesses another being via esoteric and-or psychic and-or magical methods) of non-Earth-origin, and this human was born October 4 (four) 1952 CE (Common Era) and has lived at 30002 Cinnamon Way in the city of North Olmsted in the state of Ohio part of the USA (United States of America) on planet Earth which is the third planet in the Solar System Sol which is located in the Milky Way Galaxy which is nearby the larger galaxy Andromeda in a galactic poor cluster.  This aforementioned Dark Queen has had the phone/telephone numbers - 440-427-9210 [home phone], 440-829-7395 [personal cell phone number], 216-761-3344 [old work phone number], 216-299-8994 [old work cell phone number] - and the email address 'slreeves@wowway.com' as well as the Internet email address 'sallyreeves21@yahoo.com' and associated with humans/human-vessels named 'Ruth Fielder' and 'Diane Minnery' as well as 'Jean Hays' and 'Kate ORourke'.  She is a woman, a human female, homo sapiens sapiens species, and she has a life-long apparant female personality and consistent female nature.

Idea #0026:
	Sally Lynn Reeves (Common Vessel as described in Idea #0025) has been on a number of medications/pharmecuticals for decades, and such aforementioned meds/medications include [but are by default presumption simultaneously not limited to] the following: Advair, Albuterol, Amantadine, Baclofen, Calcium supplements, Cardizem-CD, Celebrex, Copaxone, Crestor, Cymbalta, Cytomel, Dilantin, Finacea, Fish Oil, Flexeril, Klonopin, Lasix, Lunesta, Lyrica, Maxalt, Miralax, Multivitamins, Nabumetone, Nexium, Oxytrol, Provigil, Ritalin, Singulair, Synthroid, Topomax, Zyrtec.  In addition, aforementioned Sally L Reeves (the same Common Vessel as described in Idea #0025) is allergic to the follwing: Penicillin, EES, Bactrim, Augmentin, Tetracycline, PPD, Tetanus Toxoid vaccine, PPD.  Also, aforementioned Sally Reeves (who is also the same Common Vessel described in Idea #0025) has health issues/diseases/health-conditions/illnesses/sicknesses which include but are not limited to: Multiple Sclerosis, MVP, GERD, Asthma, Slow gastric emptying, Migraines, Joint inflammation R/O arthritis, Low IgA, Hashimotos Thyroiditis, mitral valve prolapse/arrythmias, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia.  The same Sally (who by default presumption is the Common Vessel described in Idea #0025) has the following apparant human doctors to which she is assigned as a patient which include but are not limited to: Candice Zubricky, Christiana Bo, A Romeo Craciun, Nancy McBride, Mousaab Tabbaa, 'Doctor Marsh'.  Sally's apparant human doctors have specialties which include but are not limited to: Family Practice, Rhumetology, Neurology, Endocrinology, Gastroentorology, Pulmonary Sleep Medicine, Psychiatry.  Note that the aforementioned 'Doctor Marsh' is or was an apparant human psychiatrist as well as an apparant human female that was shocked and astonished during a telephone that Proto could speak American English in complete and intelligent sentences comparable to a healthy and non-disabled mature human adult being and also handle back-and-forth listening and speaking of American English in an intelligent and practical as well as mundane and non-esoteric manner just like an adult male human being [Her reaction during the phone call was quite comical, as she was expecting someone mentally retarded or something when she realized who she was talking to, and she practically shit a brick and was caught completely off-guard when asked an intelligent and NORMAL human American English in a NORMAL intelligent and very innocent voice just like a typical healthy grown human being would.  Obviously she was lied to about Sally's 'adult son', putting two-and-two together.] ['Comical' means 'funny', airhead.  I was laughing afterwards.].   

Idea #0027:
	I am not always serious, and am often playful without meaning to be playful.  Other times I am deliberately playful.  Irregardless, sometimes I mean to be serious and am trying to be very serious, and I get misunderstood as being playful.  It happens all the time, and often I don't realize whether I'm trying to be playful or not, and neither does someone I'm talking to.

Idea #0028:
	Most zarakite values are anti-dark-trio, which can also be said to be opposite-of-dark-hearted-trio-values.  Nearly all zarakite values at least are non-dark-hearted-trio/not-at-all-dark-trio.

Idea #0029:
	Sally Reeves is slow by nature, as well as lazy by nature.  She is slow and lazy and lethargic and lacking energy all in a sense that refers to physical activity, and she sleeps and reclines a lot.  She lacks physical energy and has a lot of mental energy with a very forceful personality that uses a massive amount of mental energy with every thought and every emotion, regardless of emotional state, easily and effortlessly for the most part, it seems, for long decades and perhaps far longer, spanning millenia and longer in duration.  Her mental process and natural mental abilities are obviously what Proto and sky boys would call non-human as well as naturally psychic, and very powerful as such, and clearly non-Earth-origin, as Earth-origin life doesn't naturally have such a forceful almighty natural thought process and personality that is so natural and casual and in a state of normalcy/being-normal.  She's always been this way, or her possessor has always been this way, or both.

Idea #0030:
	Proto lacks dark trio values, and such is normal for Proto, as well as consistent, and Proto has well-established pretense for this that spans decades of consistency.

Idea #0031:
	Sky boys [all] lack dark trio values, and such is normal for sky boys of all types, as well as consistency for this, and sky boys also have pretense for all these things life-long with consistency as normalcy.

Idea #0032:
	Ancients live as ancients up to five hours than die, and must become hybrids to avoid this, and can be made into hybrids by dragon boys right after being born as an ancient
	Ancients with a head [and a spirit, and a life of course] must be born as an infant [which resembles a human that is about eight years old], while ancients that are born without a head but have a neck [as a replacement body for a hybrid, as hybrids can't regenerate most of their anatomy] can be any age [any of the five ages]
	Ancients without a head and without a neck are for practice as dragon boys make ancient replacement bodies with various body artworks and natural legwear and natural feet/footwear
	Ancients always have juvenile markings, and when they become hybrids such hybrids always have juvenile markings, and when becoming sky children such sky children are infant-aged [the youngest of the five ages] and have juvenlie markings.  Such hybrids live as hybrids for five years before becoming sky children
	'Sky boy' which is single and has the plural form 'sky boys' is a proper and scientific and normal and 'textbook' name for a collection of all of the clans of Zare's direct and indirect offspring that refer to - zarakites [with one, two, four, or five heads], half zarakites, sky children [also called 'sky kids'], kahjeet, cents, elves, etc - and 'boy' in zarakite english languages is a casual and common way to refer to a sky boy, plural 'boys'.  'Boy' used to refer to a sky boy is comparable to Human American English where 'cop' is used to refer to a 'police officer'.
	'Juvenile markings' which can also be called 'youth markings' are body artwork and natural tattoos [made from high-detail pigmentation variations in the flesh, high detail and potentially colorful and vivid, literally with the same potential resolution and color differentiation and range of colors and detail as a human technology high-resolution inkjet computer photo printer, although sky boy tattoos which are included in sky boy body artwork also include metallic and chrome colors that are reflective like a mirror as well as transparent and translucent colors that are used with technology and tools grown from gloves but not part of any jewelry or tattoos] [?]
	'Juvelile markings' are always worn, involuntarily, and can't be taken off, other than by waiting for such markings to one day dissapear within a split second, something that naturally happens when a sky boy has become old enough.  For dragon boys this has nothing to do with the sky boy's age, and a dragon boy shape-shifting to change their age doesn't find that his juvenile markings dissappear [or reappear, if the sky boy has become old enough] from such shape-shifting.
	A sky boy who puts on body artwork to mimic or imitate juvenile markings is typically conducting illicit and perhaps illegal behavior, as Zarakite Law sees it, and during The Transition Period as human laws see it, generally speaking.
 	Sky boys always have some body artwork tattoos present in addition to the zarakite tribal crest or 'icon' [which have many synonymous terms] always present on every right-hand upper arm, in-between the top of the shoulder and the bottom edge of the elbow if the arm is bent 90 (ninety) degrees, naturally facing outward and away from the sky boy [unless some jack--- is pulling on his skin or something].  Such tribal icons can never be taken off, and are always worn whether the sky boy wants it or not, and sky boy flesh doesn't ever scar or disfigure, and all sky boy body artwork heals without scarring and without scabs as well, even if dismemberment and other extreme injuries occur, and this is normal for all sky boy body artwork and skin/flesh, lifelong.  Also note that if a sky boy puts on additional body artwork tattoos and such covers his arm, it goes on underneath his tribal icon as well as juvenile markings on all parts of his anatomy, and is always happens that way whether or not he wants it.  Tribal icons and juvenile markings are easily visible as such regardless of anything they are combined with as body artwork, and such is like printing out such on computer printer photo paper and finding that tribal icons and juvenile markings are visisble and recognizable with any background colors, regardless of the border colors of such markings and such icons.  [Some tribal icons have translucent and alpha colored components, along a gradient, which leaves the background color partly or completely visible].  [Note that his has consistency with earlier documents].  As for other body artwork, all sky boys always have natural legwear and natural footwear of some style and some combination of colors, at all times, always, and never have feet that have individual multiple toes like humans do.  They shape-shift and change from one style or combination of colors to another directly.  A sky boy of any clan who is missing a foot either has something degenerated or deflated, or is missing a detachable [feet don't detach from legs, but individual legs detach from the pelvis, at the top of the upper leg, which is consistent, and feet detaching from the lower leg is a misunderstanding that needed correction as no sky boys have such].  Either that or he was swordfighting and had a foot cut off or something, which is also common, until he gets a new one, or 'grows a new one' as sky boys speaking Zarakite English would say [referring to all sorts of anatomical parts], or he gets a new skin, etc.  All sky boys who have complete skins always have some type of legwear, some type of footwear for both feet, both natural of course, and a natural wallet chain and natural wallet that is typically kept inside a right-hand legwear/natural-legwear pocket, and the wallet chain is adjustable in length and color via shape-shifting, and the wallet chain can have darn near any color under the suns including metallics, etc.  Sky boys also have another chain, ending in a small ring, on the opposite side of their legs, also with a retractable length, although such left-hand secondary chain can have a 'zero' length, fully retracted, leaving just the ring [?].  Wallet chains are grown out of the pelvis and hips, on the side of the body, and out of a spot at the top of the waistband of whatever legwear they have, and such is far enough to the side of course that they are beyond the gap/longwinds-gap.  All sky boys of all ages and all sizes and all clans have a gap whether they want to or not, such is characteristic of their anatomy and how their legwear grows.  All sky boys grow their waistband out of the same areas of their pelvis and at the same height, whether or not they want to, and are used to such.  Compared to the human species and human clothing, such appears to be worn somewhat 'low' yet on the other hand because such legwear is 'attached' [grown out of the body and still part of the body, complete with nerves and nerve endings and still living tissue, including any zipper moving by itself just like most Earth-origin land life mammals have skeletal muscles that move various body parts, etc], but on the other hand no sky boy ever has a 'plumbers crack' that can ever be visible [unless one yanks on the back of their legwear and stares down into their anatomy, though at the center of the back of the waistband, the legwear is attached and grows out of the body, as well as at the hips], and a sky boy's legwear can't 'fall down' yet on the other hand can't be 'pulled up' either.  As for shirts and jackets and various types of body jewelry, such is optional, a sky boy of any clan and any age can take those on and off via shape-shifting and generation and degeneration.  Shirts and jackets are 'attached' [grown out of the body] inbetween the bottom of any neck and the shoulders, at the top of the torso.  A sky boy can also detach any shirt or jacket as a detachable, and wear it 'loose' [and actually not be naked as such, as he is actually wearing something that is not part of his anatomy] yet also give it to someone else, including a hybrid as well as a human.  Hybrids cannot grow their own natural clothing or body art, and are stuck with whatever legwear and footwear and body artwork tattoos that are with that body, which can be changed by getting another body, by getting their head attached to another body after being detached from the old one, and without putting on any shirt or jacket or clothing from a sky boy [or clothing from another species, like a human, if available] a hybrid is shirtless [?].  A human can also put on a shirt grown from a sky boy, if they don't mind wearing a peice of hide and anatomy that a teenage boy might hypothetically grown out of himself and give color of some kind and perhaps artwork and graphics of some kind to, and then hand to a human.  Such wouldn't be the same as killing a non-sentient wild animal such as a deer or raccoon and wearing the skin of such, or leather, but as for feel and comfort one would have to ask a human.  A sky boy likely wouldn't mind a casual request to give a shirt to a human to try on, barely interrupting any other common conversation, as sky boys are used to regrowing and shape-shifting and regenerating their skins and parts of their skins all the time, and wouldn't mind extra bits and peices and parts of such laying around, as such make good worms for the planet anyways.
	There are five different styles of legwear a sky boy can have.
	There are five or ten types of hair styles a sky boy can have [?].  Hair styles have dynamic/changeable length [?].
	There are five types of footwear styles a sky boy can have [incomplete] [?].
	Styles of natural clothing for sky boys can have many potential colors and combinations of colors, as well as solid colors and with graphics and logos and various designs, and metallics and relfective colors and parts of graphics and patterns as well, but not translucents or transparent colors, and such combinations are countless, and have nothing to do with the potential shape and texture which is the 'style' and is limited in how many potential variations there are.  A single component of natural clothing can only be one style at a time, except in the middle of shape-shifting, which only takes half a second of time [?].
	A sky boy who wears a shirt 'loose' is wearing a shirt that is not part of his anatomy, from one of his own skins or someone else, and he of course can't shape-shift it, and can't change any color or colors or graphics on it, although he can take it off and grow his own if someone decides that they want to claim that they are 'offended' by it and make conversation of such which in some cases is deliberately loud and attention-getting, which is not the same thing as someone who thinks the sky boy should change their shirt.  [Regarding the last two parts of that sentence, the first is what the dark queen does, and is a tactic she frequently uses over the years and decades, perhaps longer, sometimes in conjunction with psychic techniques and psychic spells etc, and the latter is what a sky boy as well as a human would do, such as a schoolteacher or shopping mall security, whatever.  Note that the former technique is something the dark queen will in certain cases combine with 'playing the victim' and other psychological warfare techniques, as well as what a human might call 'child abuse' and in some cases 'deception by proxy' or 'Munchausen syndrome by proxy', though such terms are normally applicable if I'm not mistaken to one or more of the human species being evil to one of their own kind, both from the same world of origin, and not involving other species of multiple worlds of origin, as well as esoterics such as psychics and magicians and non-mundane stuff.]
	'worn' in zarakite english [present in the flesh, Zarakite English languages call such 'worn', and use the term 'wear' as well as 'put on' to refer to shape-shifting to have such ma ] [incomplete]
	A sky boy will sometimes use the term 'race' to refer to what he means as a 'clan' in Zarakite English languages, and 'race' is a causal term for 'clan' as such.
	'Dragon sky boy' is a term that refers to zarakites and half zarakites collectively, and 'dragon boy' is a short form of such, in Zarakite English languages.
	'Half dragon' and 'half blood' are casual and slang and technically improper terms to refer to half zarakites.
	Zarakites are a dragon species, and this is a proper and technical and academically correct understanding, as well as the fact that there are other species of dragons that have nothing to do with zarakites and are not shape-shifters necessarily [varies] and are not necessarily bipedal humanoid in a natural form/form-factor.
	Zarakite English languages including Zarakite American English use single quotes where Human American English would use double quotation marks, and Zarakite American English uses both 'miles' and 'kilometers', though 'kilometers' and other metric units are used for specific measurements [measurements that have a number or a specific quantity, etc] as well as generalized ways to refer to something in casual conversation such as 'You'll have a long walk, that's many kilometers away.....', while imperial units such as miles are typically only used to refer to generalized measurements that don't have any specific value when referring to units of length, such as 'You'll have a long walk, that's many miles away.....'.  Punctuation marks as well as commas are used outside of quotation marks in Zarakite English languages [which include Zarakite American English, Zarakite British English, Zarakite Austrailian English, etc].  'Sky boy' can also be substituted for 'zarakite' when referring to such languages, so one could say 'Sky Boy British English' as well as 'Sky Boy German' instead of 'Zarakite British English' and 'Zarakite German', respectively.  Zarakite American English also uses metric instead of imperial for weight, and other things measured, etc, and sky boys of all clans find such natural and intuitive, and would have to stop and deliberately put effort into mental math and perhaps use a calculator or something to figure out exactly how many miles long something is as well as exactly or even approximately how many pounds something weighs on Earth as opposed to kilograms.  Sky boys can read and write and speak and hear their versions of such languages naturally and intuitively, and such comes with pre-determined experience, and such have the same accents and pronounciations as the human versions of such, and are typed and handwritten with the same spellings and in the same handwriting styles as humans would do with their human versions of such languages.  [This was also true with fantasy-fiction 'zarakites' from the Original Texts, when those 'zarakites' would speak and hear and handwrite human languages, if they had learned such languages, and such had consistency with the various forms of The Original Texts.]  A human being who isn't looking at a sky boy speaking to him or her [humans have two genders, such is and was normal for their species], typically can't tell if the sky boy is actually a sky boy of some clan or a youthful human boy, at least not from simple and short conversation.  If the conversation continues, they'll figure it out, when slang terms and common terms come up in conversation, as well as a sky boy's personality, and what the sky boy likes and dislikes and feels like talking about.  The sky boy's humor and wisecracks, if present, are easily mistaken for that of a human male teenager, as well as his profanity.  Speaking of which, a sky boy will commonly prank such an ignorant human, and be playful by pretending to be a human during such conversation, which actually isn't that difficult for the sky boy.  A juvenile sky boy who hasn't been a sky boy for even a day can do this quite easily, and so can hybrids that were ancients in many cases.

Idea #0033:
	One can logically and realistically and accurately [precisely?] conclude that these ideas were not typed by an adult or non-juvenile, but instead by a very young infant that isn't human, which is indeed correct.

Idea #0034:
	Ideas #0012 through #0031 [which include all of the ideas numbered in-between 0012 and 0031 as well as 0012 itself and 0031 itself], as well as idea #0033 and ideas #0000 through #0009, are all - true, real, honest, sincere, lacking symbolic nature, lacking symbolic content, lacking deception invariably - in real life in this universe and perhaps also in real [As established, 'in real' includes 'real life' but also includes more than such].

Idea #0035:
	Sally Reeves has [present tense] and possibly had [past tense] Lupus [a human sickness and possibly disease of some sort].

Idea #0036:
	The letter I typed and printed out for the supervisor nurse where I live, which describes my need for salt, and how Florinef and compression stockings etc didn't work for me, and my history of such things, was honest, and hasn't changed.  I still need a lot of extra salt in my diet even if I hypothetically became diabetic, and extra drinks and such available as well, which include caffiene, and a lot of caffiene, more than what a human being would survive.  I also do a lot better with various flavorings and butters and mayo and condiments of various sorts, in large amounts, and typically use and do good with a lot of them in amounts that are far beyond what a healthy normal human being would survive.  Also I do well with lots of candy such as candy bars of various sorts and chocolates and peanut butter cups and twinkies and pastries with frostings of various sorts with lots of sugar and fat in many cases, large amounts that would make a normal healthy human being of any age very overweight and likely dead in less than a month's time.  I do well long-term with these types of things as a regular diet sustained consistently for years at a time even though such would kill a normal healthy human being of any age in less than a day, and in some cases even partway through one meal.  Also I don't have any risk of heart attacks or unhealthy blood sugar or history of such things from such a diet.

Idea #0037:
	A good thing to do, according to zarakite values, is to have a proper mission briefing at headquarters with allies and soldiers and one's own co-workers and troops, in a protected environment, with protected conversations where everyone in the briefing room is not only allowed and able to be honest and sincere and open non-stop and continually with each other, but is actually expected to do so, and just does, without fear or worry about eavesdropping or any enemy forces picking up any of the conversation, and without worry or fear of any of the public or common folk who arn't cleared for a restricted soldier class conversation to be aware of or involved in such a meeting which is really none of their business and causes problems and is a security risk.  Also, such a protected and restricted meeting before deploying troops and other allied forces insures that everyone [referring to all the soldiers that will be fighting, as well as all supervisors and leaders, in all groups of course] knows what they are doing and what the mutually agreed game plan is when the troops are deployed and everyone goes out to fight battles.  This is all a good thing.  By comparison, if all soldiers are thrown into a battle they never heard of and didn't even know that they are supposed to be deployed or what their orders are or even might be or who they or anyone else are supposed to answer to, and everyone they come across is deceptive and dishonest and keeps changing their story and consistently lacks consistency beyond belief and embraces as well as encourages and perpetuates and snowballs mass confusion and illusions and deceptions and lies and continual non-stop lack of consistency as well, with no end in sight, confusing everybody so that no one knows who is a good guy and who is a bad guy and who their allies are supposed to be and who their enemies are supposed to be and who or what they are supposed to be fighting for or whatever, there's just a wee little bit of a problem with such mass bulls---, just a little bit, just, uh, maybe, ya know?  Like, um something called EVIL which deserves to be shouted loud enough to quake the next galactic filament and a few others.  Need I say that such applies to how zarakite values see it?  How about how dark hearted absolutely love and adore such mass confusion and infighting, where 'allies' that are supposed to be with each other are simply fighting each other, leaving what should be their mutual enemies laughing and smiling, allowing them to walk away then walk back in and walk around, coming and going, as if they owned the place because they do, and they are more than allowed and able to do so, and win whenever they want to without a fight, which certainly serves their reputation, because after all they can look pacifistic and harmless, not fighting anyone and not being aggressive with anyone, not picking a fight with anyone, and no one hates them and no one is interested in seeing that they are any enemy or any sort of threat at all, and they don't look the slightest bit evil to anyone, and they can easily claim to be innocent and no one bothers to really refute them, and they don't have to work hard to convince anyone that they are supposedly innocent and harmless and pacifistic.  Paul S Reeves has always been like this, and Matthew Damron has also been really good with the same strategy over the years, not to mention Larry Falasca who will just sit around and fake being some innocent and harmless mentally ill man who would never harm anyone and is another so-called pacifist.  Sally Lynn Reeves and Martin Eric Reeves have also used these strategies as well, with a long history of a pretense for doing so and making it work for them, appearing to be pacifist and non-violent and non-aggressive individuals that are allegedly harmless and would never be a threat to anyone, and all three of them have a history of such well-entrenched pretense in mundane and non-esoteric and non-psychic and non-magical ways, in addition to all the psychic and magical and undefined esoteric stuff they have which is so invisible and secretive and deceptive and anything but apparent.  This is a lot of honest information, and very real to begin with, and still is, and won't change any time within the next million years or so, considering their long established history of being like this, more or less among them.  Meanwhile, the beleagured and pissed cranky author of this is a bit disgruntled and crabby from a lack of caffiene, and isn't doing too well as such.  At least he cares, as always, and meanwhile some very dark hearted humans simply don't care, and just admitted it, and it does indeed show, and is indeed very real and not just putting on a face, or 'being professional', but is authentic, and I have no reason to see otherwise, no connection points, nothing witnessed that indicates otherwise.

Idea #0038:
	Regarding the photos and media of the chosen available in directories/folders of WHITE RAIN files, optimal photos for what is most appealing to The Zarakite Sex Drive that all sky boys have is not available for all faces.  For some, photos are available that don't show what is sexy to a sky boy because the photos don't show the person at the right age.  What is sexy to the Zarakite Sex Drive is from 8 (eight) years old to 16.34 (sixteen point three four) years old, applicable more or less to all of the chosen and all future chosen for any missing incomplete entries and vacancies, and not dressed or groomed for a career or an adult human lifestyle but a teenage lifestyle which isn't grown up yet and still hangs out at places and goes to parties etc.

Idea #0039:
	Sky boys are almost always technically naked, as their clothing and footwear is part of their body, complete with nerves and sense of touch and temperature that goes to at least one of their brains.  If - ripped, cut, torn, etc -, such clothing naturally regrows itself from involuntary reflexes and regeneration.  Their clothing and footwear are parts of their skin/flesh, and when damaged cause bleeding, dragon blood that glows brightly.  These things also apply to their natural jewelry.  The magical blood of sky boys have a range of opacity that the blood has while maintaining the same color, which is a magic pure blue of planet Earth, an extremely saturated/vibrant pure blue that is not light or dark, the same color as the natural normal color of the iris of a sky boy's eyeballs in a normal healthy state.  When a sky boy's magic is at or near his magic's limit, his blood has the most opacity, a very solid aforementioned blue that doesn't have translucency if such blood is spilled and spread thinly across a non-pourous and non-absorbant surface.  

Idea #0040:
	Sky boys don't sleep.  If they do start to 'sleep', they die.

Idea #0041:
	One type of legwear that sky boys can put on are called 'longwinds'.  They are adjustable in length, and both legs in syncronization can be adjusted so that they are more or less baggy.  Such affects the entire legs with constant and steady proportion [having a look that resembles 'bellbottoms', an archaic human synthetic article of clothing made from a different species native to the same planet of origin as sky boys, isn't possible as such].  At the most baggy [sky boys also call it 'loose'], individual legs of longwinds that are stretched out on a flat surface as best as practical [without cutting them or stretching them or otherwise deforming their shape], fan out both left and right at 45 (forty-five) degree angles to form two side edges of sky boy fabric that are perpendicular at a 90 (degree) angle.  When least baggy, or worn 'tight' as a sky boy would describe it in Sky Boy American English, the legs of a sky boy's legwear are still fairly loose and baggy, and easily have enough legroom for three of his legs side-by-side inside each leg of his longwinds if one were to even-out the measurements of the circumference of one of his legs and average/even them out.  As for the length of each leg, they are dynamic and adjusted in sync as well, and can range from reaching just below the kneecap to around the ankles and about 5 (five) centimeters from touching the ground or a flat surface.  A sky boy is born with the instintive and intuitive natural innate shape-shifting ability to use his belly button and wristwatches to shorten and lengthen his longwinds, as well as loosen and tighten them, casually and easily, with negligible depletion of magic when doing so.  Adjusting his longwinds as such isn't necessarily silent, just like all shapeshifting, and if done very slowly is near-silent and suitable for hunting and stalking prey, at least from a distance.  Adjusting his longwinds with major changes in a rapid split-second [akin-to/much-like if he were to deflate or degenerate his neck while detaching it in half a second flat, so his head falls from mid-air above his neck-less body and bounces and rolls depending on the terrain and whatever he might be standing on/in], just like adjusting parts of his flesh of his skin and limbs etc, makes a characteristic noise that all sky boys clearly recognize and are familiar with.  Like all sky boy natural clothing, such parts of a sky boy's physical anatomy in normal three dimensional space where he lives [as opposed to tethered anatomy which is safely and responsibly 'extradimensional' and maintained by elven sky boys who have applicable and sufficient experience and expertise in such, and are more than capable of doing this safely] does not have any sense of physical touch or temperature that his head brain[s] can sense, unlike the flesh of his anatomy.  Also, like other sky boy natural clothing, shape shifting such clothing doesn't come with any sense of touch or temperature from aforementioned shape shifting itself.  Sky boy longwinds have an elastic waistband at the top.

Idea #0042:
	The word 'doof' in Zarakite American English is a slang term for 'idiot' or 'clown', etc, referring to someone who performs an act of stupidity, regardless of their normal intellect and underlying intelligence.

Idea #0043:
	If it ain't broke, don't 'fix' it.
		- Basic common sense, zarakite values and logic
Idea #0044:
	'If it ain't broke, don't 'fix' it' in zarakite logic as well as zarakite logic, is like saying 'If something already works good enough, don't try to [so-called] 'repair' the blasted contraption [it], because do so has the potential to actually make it worse and non-functional by taking it apart completely and putting it back together [or at least trying to] and finding it doesn't work anymore'.  This type of outcome, a machine no longer working by attempting to improve it by taking it apart and doing work on it then attempting to reassemble it, by logic, is in a general sense more likely/probable the more complicated the machine is given a mechanic/technician who has a constant/invariable level of expertise [or lack of such, doof].  One could also say, as a synonamous phrase 'If it's already working and doing it's job, don't mess with it.' and such has the same meaning, more or less.

Idea #0045:
	One cannot win unless they try.
		- Basic common sense, zarakite values

Idea #0046:
	One cannot regain what they never had to begin with.
		- Basic common sense philosophy, zarakite values, the short version

Idea #0047:
	You can't win if you don't even try.
		- Basic common sense philosophy, zarakite values, non-absolutionist

Idea #0048:
	If it ain't allowed to happen, it ain't gonna happen.
		- Basic common sense principle, archaic version, not as such would be written in Zarakite American English

Idea #0049:
	If it isn't able to happen, it isn't going to happen.
		- Basic common sense principle, zarakite values

Idea #0050:
	Sky boys wouldn't explain this to each other, regardless of how old, and regardless of clan, as they understand it already, but the phrase 'If it isn't able to happen, it isn't going to happen' refers to practical basic common sense and logic in both zarakite values and logic that all sky boys and their hybrids have, which describes that if some desired outcome and result is prevented from occuring because of what is not just improbable but is outright impossible, then according-to/by logic such an end-result/outcome/result/effect is not going to occur, any-way-one-looks-at-it/regardless-of-anyone's-opinion/no-matter-how-anyone-thinks-about-it/no-matter-what/any-way-one-slices-it.  As a hypothetical example, if a star is destroyed and turned into loose gas and dust, the star that was destroyed is not going to give light and heat afterwards that sustains life on an inhabited planet that used to orbit the star that had natural and native sentient life on it, and this is because the star is no longer able to do so, and has nothing to do with if the no-longer-existing star 'isn't trying very hard' or 'is spinning it's wheels' or 'has an attitude problem' or 'is upset or bored or something' or 'is hyper' or 'needs to behave itself' or 'needs to calm down' or 'needs to cool it' [It's already DEAD!  No more light and heat!  Hello.....?] or 'doesn't care' or 'is evil' or 'hates itself' or 'hates anyone or anything else' or 'isn't feeling comfortable' or 'isn't sure if it really should or not' or 'isn't paying attention' or 'is irresponsible' or 'isn't ready' or 'has a confidence issue' or 'has a self esteem problem' or 'how it feels about itself' or whether or not the star 'feels it belongs' or 'isn't cut out for something' or whatever.  Simply put, the star doesn't exist any longer, and as such one cannot refute that the star is therefore not going to give what a life-bearing planet used to have so that the planet can sustain any form of life, at least not like what it did back when the star existed.  Also, once the star no longer exists, at that point in itself in the strictest sense according to zarakite values and logic the star is not at fault for not supporting the planet or the life on it, reffering to the behavior of the star at that present tense snapshot point in time when the star already doesn't exist.  As for anything the star did back when it did exist, well, that's another story, and irregardless/beside-the-point.  Further, once the star no longer exists, if one were to recline and think extensively and think deeply for an obscene eternity and a half, and accumulate a mass of knowledge and insight and ideas, that still won't save the life on the planet, and the star will still be GONE.  One who is such a deep thinker can hypothetically think however long they want to in order to try to come up with a 'plan' or 'solution' for making the no-longer-existing-star give continual heat and light and otherwise to sustain the life on the planet as it did back when it existed, yet such a 'solution' simply doesn't exist, because sometimes, just sometimes, dear salt-head, something isn't just improbable, it's a thing called 'impossible', and there isn't any such 'solution'.  Begging for an answer from an almight truly omniscient oracle that is actually and literally all-knowing of all worlds in an entire universe and knows all of every single sub-atomic particle of such and the history of every such particle since the birth of such universe doesn't necessarily mean that such an oracle will actually know of any actual solution or answer, and if asked for a solution, can just say 'there isn't one' flatly in a quick and simple and straight honest response.  If they were bothered by some salthead asking the same question again, the response could be 'The real answer hasn't changed.  Also, don't bother me again thinking that it will.  Trust me, it won't, ever.  That's an absolute truth and absolute honest answer, and it won't change.  Don't bug me again, I'm busy, forever.  Bye!'.  One could say that this is one of those 'irrefutable things' that they just HAVE TO have an understanding of, even if it has to be drilled and pounded into their brain's anatomy or whatever lifeless and useless inanimate heap of s--- they are 'thinking' with, as if.  ['Hey doc, it hurts when I do this!'  'Well, then don't do that!']  Even a mere human, a homo sapiens sapiens species species man, an individual named 'Albert Einstien' came up with his 'definition of stupidity' regarding such a screwball hypothetical, boring as it is, which believe it or not the vast majority of the human speicies thorughout it's history of being intelligent/sentient can actually comprehend and understand quite easily, without effort and without thinking about it and without 'working at it', with quick practical common sense.  As for the rest, those 'intellects' Zare of SkyCrowne would say are mentally ill and irrefutable as such, forver doomed to futility if unchanged.  One can also say 'If something doesn't exist, it can't do anything' and be honest and true about it, as an irrefutable and logical absolute honest truth, at least in this universe, at least where Zare of SkyCrowne and his zarakite values exist.  As for quack-logic and weird theoretical stuff that can't, this author can't help you, at least not with any sort of conversation or communication as he would call it, ever.  For those who actually read this far, yes, this is the long version of the saying in zarakite values, which presumably answers one's questions about the philosophical saying and understanding of how real life works in sanity and lack of delusions, and hopefully elaborates to one's satisfaction, yikes.....

Idea #0051:
	Wandering into a movie theater when half of the film is already halfway over means ending up clueless and not knowing what much of the movie is about, and not enjoying the film either, and therefore as such not worth going to anyways because too much of the film already played, in my experience.  Bothering people watching the film probably wouldn't be a good idea either, as I would imagine that they wouldn't want to put up with explaining what the film was about and what happened and would probably rather watch the rest of the film, not that I've actually tried such a thing, but I typically try to avoid finding out as I don't like to bother people and be an annoying brat.  I would just go see the movie again another time, and see it from the beginning, and then I enjoy it, and I'm not clueless, and I don't have to be stuck with being an annoying brat and ruining the rest of the movie for others as well as still not enjoying the film, versus leaving and watching the whole thing properly by seeing it from the beginning some other time which is what I would do because it is what I should do, for both myself and everyone else at the movie theater, a win-win situation, better for me and better for them.  This means that they enjoy the film, and so do I, and I don't have to be an annoying brat or be someone clueless, which all works and is just common sense that I don't have to really think about, of course.  Such is also logical all the way, how this all just works.  Such logic and practical common sense is natural and commonplace in sky boy personalities, and also very good in zarakite values.  Meanwhile, dark hearted trio would all fake this type of stuff, while not actually doing it, but pretending to do so, while being deceptive and mind reading people back and forth and also mind controlling them left and right and their nature and their souls, and even their children, at the movie theater, en masse, and it's not like anyone would really know or find out, or care.

Idea #0052:
	As I've well understood in the past, and still do even to this day, the character Jack O'Malley from Deus Ex Human Revolutions is irrefutably evil according to zarakite values within his realm and his world, killing innocents and soldier class in his world left and right with lies and deceptions and mind games, hanging with ghetto drug dealers and thugs and brutes and criminals in acts of corruption, pitting them against each other and starting gang wars while making himself look innocent, creating mass confusion and illusions left and right, infighting, as the gangs fight each other and don't understand how it started but only think they do, and don't blame Jack O' Malley or see him as an enemy yet should but don't even know it.  Jack O'Malley as such is dark hearted trio and dark hearted, creating confusion and profiting from it at the same time while easily looking innocent and getting away with it, as a corrupt undercover police officer or government special agent of some sort who one or two rare individuals might suspect but no one comes up with any actual evidence on, elusive and deceptive and secretive and getting away with it and even admitting it out-loud to the video game's main protagonist Adam Jenson that he does indeed kill and slaughter people in acts of evil on a daily basis and is casual and even bored and apathetic about it [like 'Ho-hum, I just murdered a really good police officer in an act of homicide and evil and got away with it, again, and it's not like I found it exciting or stimulating or anything, much more than noticing a bug crawling up a wall because it bores me, just like the last few thousand times over the last decade or whatever, I'm falling asleep here, whatever, oh, and Jenson here seems fairly gullible and stupid prey, and isn't even sure if I'm even a bad guy or not, and is even willing to cut a deal with me for a bottle of wine and a payoff that's pocket change to me and he considers it a victory and sucess in his quest log book or whatever as I get to go out and kill more people and do more evil as some underground ghetto god of some sort, yawn...'].  I for one was shocked that the game marked the quest as completed successfully and properly if Jenson indeed accepts the bottle of wine and bribe, which Jack O'Malley leaves on Jenson's own coffee table right in his apartment when Jenson isn't even home, and is from that point on untouchable and untraceable and GONE for the rest of the video game, a criminal and very dangerous man who gets away and does more evil, and never comes back.  In contrast, if Jenson sees to it that Jack O'Malley is arrested and convicted, and is no longer a threat to so many, and is disempowered, by being put behind bars, or killed as an enemy [which does pretty much the same thing, of course], the mission is over and considered a failure, and the game moves onward and Jenson loses the quest irrevocably.  Fortunately it is a side quest, and isn't essential to completing the game.  On the other hand, Jenson isn't a cop anymore, and in fact was fired from the local police department in the game and shouldn't be involving himself in such matters, no longer working in law enforcement, as well as lucky he gets to work as a security officer of some kind for a private corporation.  That and I found it surprising that he got hired as the security manager [the head guy, in charge of all of their security, at all of their business locations, not just their corporate headquarters, but also the plant where Josie Thorp works etc].  Even more shocking and revolting to myself is how he is a brash and misbehaving bully, and talks to his boss David Sarif who is the CEO in charge of the company like an unruly child who argues with Mr Sarif like a little kid who has no business working there let along graduating high school and not being in the detention hall on a regular basis.  As if that wasn't bad enough, his boss CEO David Sarif puts up with Adam Jenson and lets him do that type of thing in his own office and in radio communications [might as well be 'telephone calls'] repeatedly, many times throughout the video game, as a regular thing without ever firing Jenson.  I find it odd and anything but realistic, even SANE on David Sarif's part, that he doesn't fire Adam Jenson for being such a brat and pain in the butt with Jenson's behavior on a daily basis, as a 'normal' type of thing for his company.  David Sarif, somehow, happens to also be an 'Archie Bunker' type of boss and CEO of Sarif Industries that is tough on corruption among his employess and doesn't put up with nonsense or sillyness or lazyness from people he hires, which are not only good qualities for a boss according to zarakite values, but also not asking for too much at all and not being unrealistic regarding basic expectations of employees, according to zarakite values and practical commoon sense as I see it, or at least I would think so, in real life, for most of the video game, which as I see it just makes sense.

Idea #0053:
	The Dark Queen is a being from another universe, located away from this current universe that includes the Milky Way Galaxy and planet Earth, and she falls outside the scope of many zarakite values given that she is not from this universe, to my knowledge.  She owns and controls mental illness as it has been in American Human Culture on planet Earth and is recognized my the public majority that are educated and have licenses to practice medicine in the USA, and she also owns and controls delusions and paranoia and clouded thinking of related natures among beings that are like that found on planet Earth who are sentients but not immortals [such as human beings], and comparable sentient intelligent beings that are anything like aforementioned humans in this universe regardless of species and form factor [bipedal, humanoid, aquatic, avian, fish-like, tentacled, various, etc].  Aforementioned mental illness also includes in some cases psyhic mental illness.  Aforementioned mental illness is property of the Dark Queen, and those rituals and methods are hers regardless of being presented as magical, psychic, non-esoteric, otherwise, etc.  Beings from this universe have no right to such methods that belong to the Dark Queen and have no business using such things on anyone for good or evil or any purpose, whether such beings are mortal or immortal.  The Dark Queen has a well-justified right to claim and hurt and punish and control mortal beings who develop and use such methods, and immortal beings the same, as long as such beings are not from her universe.  Meanwhile, in her universe, she sets her own rules and values regarding such things, as well as the penalties and morals if any regarding such.  All of this idea is compliant with zarakite values and demonstrates opinions and viewpoints and judgements that are supported by zarakite values, invariably as such.

Idea #0054:
	Physical violence is a natural and casual and regular way of life for carnivores and non-herbivores on planet Earth, used all the time with hunting prey and defending territory as well as defending and protecting one's offspring [and companions and own kind if sentient], of course.  All of this idea is compliant with zarakite values and demonstrates opinions and viewpoints and judgements that are supported by zarakite values, invariably as such.  This basic practical common sense understanding is not only elementary to the point that it doesn't usually need to be explained, but also consistent in zarakite values for as long as the writing and establishing of zarakite values began, and has not changed at all since then, not even once, and is still permanent.  Such is true the whole time of actual zarakite values and not any false or fake or misleading ones.  Note that this also includes such values before they were called zarakite values, and predates the turn of the century of the year 2000 AD here on planet Earth, and also was true of alternate reality and fantasy [in other words, fiction] 'zarakites' [with only two fangs and lacking penises that sting] throughout all of The Original Texts [for role playing Dungeons and Dragons pen-and-paper, imagination and fiction, comparable to what Teenage Target Culture might call a 'board game' though Teenage Target Culture is very familiar with the terms 'Dungeons and Dragons' as well as 'D and D' but only the dorks and geeks might typically know who 'Gary Gygax' is].  Such 'zarakites' from The Original Texts were magical and never psychic or telepathic beings, sort of like real dragon sky boys who happen to be zarakites, but never immune to psychics or mind controllers or any psychic evil Dungeon Master and were actually rather poor warriors, but at least they were never pets or subordinates of humans just like real-life zarakites that will be sky boys that can't ever be subordinates or pets of any human beings, yet irregardless such 'zarakites' from the Original Texts are really a different species.  [And speaking of fantasy 'zarakites' as well as how zarakites hate fakes and imposters and view such as evil in most if not all cases, real life sky boys include boys who either have four fangs or none, and never two, naturally, and never two fangs, and only imposters and fakes, perhaps created by the dark hearted who have burning and aching desires beyond belief to make fake 'zarakites' that are irregardless evil if such evil humans ever have their way, have in some cases two fangs, and in other cases none, and in a some cases retractable fangs that come and go, etc.  Such beings are simply not zarakites and in some cases are fakes and imposters and should not be trusted, and in other cases are simply another species and may in fact be innocent.  Naturally, using practical common sense that is extraneous and shouldn't have to be explained, beings that appear to be zarakites and have two fangs or no fangs or retractable fangs that call themselves zarakites and-or think they are zarakites are likely deceptive imposters and fakes that may have to explain themselves if they go around calling themselves a zarakite or thinking they are one.  Also note that zarakites are not human beings, and although real zarakites come from planet Earth according to Zare's plans and so do humans, a sentient being from planet Earth can't be a human and a zarakite at the same time, but is one or the other, never both simultaneously.  Also, no human ever becomes a zarakite, and no zarakite can ever become a human.  No zarakite would ever want to become a human, and Zare never planned for or desired such.  This information is also invariably compliant with and fully supported by zarakite values, with consistency, and Zare has never decided otherwise or changed his mind regarding such.]

Idea #0055:
	Self-empowerment of esoterics is forbidden and prohibited for beings of planet Earth and Earth-origin life according to zarakite values.  Allowing as well as making able beings of planet Earth in origin to self-empower themselves with any esoterics is also criminal and evil according to zarakites values, regardless of where one is from [any realm, any galaxy, and dimension, anywhere], including both mortals and immortals, and such evil is unforgivable and beyond belief, with evil humans with failsafe programs and cosmic failsafes and psycic control programs and secret societies etc who in various cases have pens that alter reality all as examples of why zarakite values must forbid and prohibit such evil, as well as why even an immortal of planet Earth can never do such a thing.  Another example, just as bad as humans if not worse, is an insect species from Andromeda constellation that includes many that got involved with a mind controller invasion of planet Earth and encouraged and promoted self-empowerment of the planet's immortal via handwritings and a pen, and decieved the innocent immortal who was never evil and never wanted to be evil, and never heard of such a species from Andromeda or mind controllers or thought controllers or psychics for that matter, taking advantage of his gullibility and also empowering aformentioned evil humans to self-empower themselves even further, and saw what was happening with the humans and how young and helpless and gullible the immortal was and refused to take appropriate action and insisted on making the humans more dangerous than they were to begin with as well as psychic and telepathic and mind controllers that mind controlled and thought controlled many species both on and outside of planet Earth and more than one galaxy and multiple universes and alternate dimensions as well.  One should note that the aforementioned immortal who was lied to and decieved was innocent the whole time and still is, and unfamiliar with psychics and mind controllers as well as possessors and vessels, until too late [the last year or two, but even barely so and nowhere near enough to be reasonalby expected to understand how to deal with such things properly or safely], was so gullible that he didn't even know what species he was for the first thirty-some years of his life, because of being victimized by things he had never heard of, and such an insect species from Andromeda took advantage of his gullibility and bullied him and lied to him just like many secretive human beings did, offering only an empty promise to the immortal as well as other galaxies and other entire universes and dimensions, and also discrediting the immortal just as aformentioned evil humans did, and also bullying and lying to the immortal and refusing to believe the immortal just as aforementioned evil humans did, and refusing to actually help the immortal yet pretending to just as such aforementioned evil humans did, and otherwise copying and re-enacting the same evil methods and behaviors that aforementioned evil humans did, not to mention working for a secret agenda that is nothing but evil just as the evil humans did.  This has been done by some but not all of his insect species.  I don't know how many.  I also don't know how many have been compromised by evil humans who wanted to make them become evil and extremely dangerous.  One should note that when a being has a lot of power in their hands, and they are mind controlled and compromised with such, turned into a combatant who serves a different interest, they are very dangerous with all of the power in their hands that is now under someone else's control, basic logic that just makes practical common sense, 'nuff said.  An exosolar using the identity 'Haldeman' has had a lot of failsafes in his hands, and been mind controlled by evil humans with a lot of failsafes in their hands.  Other's I guess will need to judge and decide Haldeman's actual motives and whether he is really good or not at this point, and I cannot do this, as this is way over my head and I'm too young anyways, 'nuff said.

Idea #0056:
	The Dark Queen cannot enforce or allow or enact or encourage or allow to be perpetuated or make perpetuated or not prevent things that are evil according to zarakite values, and if she didn't follow this set of rules with all of her humans on planet Earth she would look extremely evil and criminal in superhuman ways beyond belief, beyond what any human being ever could be capable of, and also her reputation would suffer among many worlds and galaxies and not just the entire universe with planet Earth and surrounding galacitc filaments, and her reputation as such is tied to potential vilification and exoneration of related things in many ways both non-esoteric and esoteric according to zarakite values, although one should keep in mind that zarakite values really don't account for what is psychic or telepathic but instead focus on zarakite magic as well as things that are non-magical and non-psychic, as zarakites are not psychic or telepathic, and neither is or was Zare, ever.  One could extrapolate to determine what zarakite values would be if they involved anything psychic, and do the same for if they involved anything telepathic, although in both cases such extrapolation is subject to potential bias, of course.

Idea #0057:
	Zarakites are very long-lived species compared to other Earth-origin life, and can take from a couple of hundred years to more than a thousand years to mature and no longer be juvenile and be expected to be responsible as an adult for their species, although the specifics within that range are cloudy.  I do not know the real answer, at least not yet, says Proto, the immortal who has been lied to so many times including by many who want to trick him into being evil via various deceptions.  Proto is no exception to zarakites, although Proto is not yet a zarakite, though he is supposed to be a zarakite.  He is also not human [and can't be anyways, as no human being is supposed to ever become a zarakite], although because of many deceptions and lies he has been victimized by he involuntarily looks a lot like a human and involuntarily is an imposter for a human that is easily mistaken for one, a disguise and deception that he never asked for and never wanted but has been bullied and forced into having, against his will.

Idea #0058:
	The CIA [Central Intelligence Agency, USA] has been working hard over the last several years with a mission goal to discredit and vilify and scapegoat Proto and also discredit and vilify and scapegoat zarakites pre-emptively and also never allow any zarakites or Proto to have any opportunity to do anything to stop any non-Earth-origin mind controller invasion or any related evil in this universe, and to also make aforementioned evil more widespread and rampant in this universe and others, and make such evils spread like wildfire and also be unstoppable.  In addition such goals of the CIA have also been to scapegoat and vilify Proto and zarakites before they exist and make them look like evil mind controllers to the entire universe that planet Earth is in and every other universe and dimension the CIA can reach, and also induce mass panic and fear and paronioa of zarakites and sky boys, fear and paranoia in the brains and thoughts and behaviors of human beings so that they are scared and terrified of any zarakites and sky boys.  The CIA have also been working to make all human beings hate and despise Proto and his wants and desires, so that Proto can never become any zarakite, and also so that Proto is bullied and victimized and tortured and teased and tantalized, and the CIA did so not only because they never want to allow Proto or his desires to be a zarakite to be accepted, but also because they want Proto to become some psychic telepath and mentally ill psychotic and delusional evil human so that Proto appears to be evil to all beings of all worlds and is removed from reality via being judged to dangerous and too evil to be permitted to exist, and hated before and after such.  If losing, and forced to accept Proto and zarakites, the CIA want and demand and work to make happen mass panic and fear of Proto and everything Proto wants, including zarakites, so that zarakites and their offspring fail and look evil and dangerous and hostile to humans as they die [as the CIA kill them, directly and indirectly], and also so that zarakites and their offspring are hated for all time, especially Zare any any zarakite Proto becomes, and in their death the CIA want Proto to look as evil and as guilty and dangerous as themselves, as well as make Proto a psychic and a telepath any way they [the CIA] can, discredited and disreputable and evil anywhere he or any zarakite go in any world or any universe and hated, and not allowed to exist, long after the demise of all human beings, which the CIA of course blame on Proto and his desires post-genocide, regardless of the fact that Proto has wanted to save sentient lives of his own planet from the beginning and always has, and be good and not evil as an immortal, and the CIA knew this and pretended they misunderstood or were told otherwise by Proto.  The CIA made the Clevleland FBI, NSA, United States Secret Service, and Russian spy agencies do the same things.

Idea #0059:
	Sally Lynn Reeves has a pain [physical pain, presumed, like when a human gets impaled in a factory but isn't dead and hasn't lost conciousness and still feels PAIN with all the shock and trauma etc] tolerance which is unlimited.  She is immune to pain and has suffers no negative effects from physical pain, at all.  Pain doesn't bother her in the slightest and doesn't do anything unpleasant for her, and I suspect actually gives her quite a bit of pleasure.  She playacts being hurt and will scream and cry only when she voluntarily chooses to.  If there is no one else around except Proto, she will go back and forth between behaving like being in pain and acting like nothing is wrong upon command, ignoring severe injury however and whenever she wants to, selectively and however it suits her in any situation.  Proto has witnessed this.  As for when she is alone, and other times when Proto isn't present, Proto cannot confirm or deny something he doesn't witness, plain and simple logic and practical common sense.  Her possessor has the capability to do this with any vessel she wants.  Mary Payne, Sally's mother, has been mind controlled by Sally in the past, and Mary Payne has had surgery without anesthetic, and declined anesthesia for surgery.  Sally also didn't think anesthesia for David was necessary when David had dental surgery to have a tooth removed, and said something like 'Well I don't think you need that' like a non-human, someone not from planet Earth who wasn't familiar with dental pain or any sort of physical pain, and wasn't familiar with the concept.  I'm not sure if Sally had another possessor for the day, perhaps someone temporary, or what happened.

Idea #0060:
	Sally Reeves has an odd way over the decades of talking like an idiot and using odd grammar, and people around her take her seriously and don't discredit her and instead treat her very seriously no matter what she says or how she says it, no matter how childish.  She can at times talk very childishly by human standards with doctors and people who work in medical careers and such, and such humans don't think she's an idiot, and give her invariable massive credibility as if she could never be a fool.

Idea #0061:
	Paul S Reeves loves to bully Proto, and has for decades, always, invariably.

Idea #0062:
	Sally Lynn Reeves has in the past bullied Proto, though other times supports him.  Her possessor has rules Proto is not privy to.  Her possessor[s] have special rules and restrictions that mandate he/she/it [?] do things at various times, rules I can't figure out as they are too complicated for me and like a complex chess game as I see it, far too complex for a human as well to figure out and make sense of I guess, though the answer is probably not black-and-white and anything but simple, like most things in real life in this universe at least.  Obviously such rules really arn't something I should meddle with, that would be very unwise and quite evil of me according to zarakite values, and humans I would imagine would see it the same way, both before and now and after and then and counter-crapwise be cranked, not bemused.  Sorry I'm just trying to be fair.  'nuff said.

Idea #0063:
	I do not have much physical pain tolerance, and never did.  My ability to handle and tolerate physical pain is far less than that of a typical human being over the decades, and is not to ever change, whether I like it or not.

Idea #0064:
	Others in the past, including various human officials, have said that it is criminal and evil and a lot more than embarassing for them and their departments to bully me in various ways including inducing physical pain and also starving and depriving me, as well as taking away my perks.  They have made references to victimizing juveniles and infants and babies heartlessly and callously with various acts of brutality and abuse, and been taken seriously, and others have agreed and listened, with their heads clearing up and thinking more rationally and childishly and more human, logical and sane.  Even the CIA have started doing this, seeing what's actually been going on.  Also, the dark hearted trio have long been with each other in abusing me in the past as a child and infant, with a long history of such.  Abuse from both has been evil just the same, evil according to zarakite values, and evil according to even human values and nearly all human religions including mainstream human religions such as Catholocism and Judaism and Islam as well as human legal systems and human lawyers and prosecutors and civil and criminal courts, consistently and invariably evil all just the same, which just makes sense, 'nuff said.

Idea #0065:
	Evil humans with failsafes in their hands, which I never would have authorized or wanted [then again, I'm young, so it's not like I know what's best with these things], have demonstrated a number of times that they can induce excrutiating and debilitating physical pain in living beings of various sorts on more than one planet and in at least Andromeda as well, turning it on and off a little bit like a switch or close to it, and they do this with their failsafes some of which actually don't belong to them, and do it in various offices, by remote, which are all over planet Earth and can arguably be anywhere.  Such are illegal within their own laws, and acts of corruption that lead to death warrants and executions that in some cases have some special designations of some sort where officials arn't allowed to arrest such humans and cannot accept taking such humans alive but are mandated to use lethal force and kill them because they are far too dangerous.  At least humans got that one right, having the potential to order deaths like that.  From what I've been told they use non-restricted lethal force to carry out those orders, such as handguns and machine guns that use ordinary bullets and don't use what I was told are called 'esoterics' which are psychic and magical stuff, and if someone records their guns with a smartphone it isn't like they happened to have recorded any top-secret ray-gun or plasma rifle or anything.  From what guides told me this type of thing has been working, and has already cleaned up some of their own kind which are too damn evil, in acts of responsibility for their own species.  These methods just work, tried and true, the same as any sky boy gun of any kind and any sky boy sword just the same etc.  Like I said, at least humans got that right, 'nuff said.

Idea #0066:
	Martin Eric Reeves truly has a dizzying intellect.  His brain-melting fuzzy logic over the decades has always been far too much for me to begin to figure out, and clearly would be an unfair opponent for me in any game of checkers.  Also, I've always hated chess, and haven't ever developed much strategy for such a game, staring at the peices for what could be long minutes and getting creamed far too easily by Paul Samuel Reeves who doesn't appear to have to really think to make the next move.  Against a computer, he can make one move after another, quick and fast and without hesitation between moves, not stopping to think, just one move then no delay and then another, amazing, as well as how he maintains really intelligent strategy that I can't come close to after mulling over long minutes of thinking.  It really is non-human and something to see.  As for Martin Eric Reeves, he is physically very slow and lumbering, bulky and stocky, with slow and lazy efforts he seems to put a lot of labor into, like a soldier trying to swing a big warhammer but taking a good several seconds just to start windup for a big and SLOW swing, where his opponent could count to ten and take a friggin coffee break before having to worry about ducking beneath his attack.  I'd say that if you can't dodge an attack like that, you'd better watch out for sticking your fingers or other body parts into what humans call a 'clock with hands' as the rotating 'hands' will snip off and sever your body parts.  He [Martin Eric Reeves] always done martial arts like that over the decades, as well as had back pain and aching joints and stuff, and he also was always a poor shot at the range, as he worked in soldier class law enforcement, United States Coast Guard, and was terrible with a handgun when he had to qualify at a range like all USA law enforcement does periodically, yet claimed proudly that he was supposedly really good at identifying targets friend from foe [Just shoot at anything that looks like a human, and also be psychic and-or use federal magic, pretty cool huh?].  On the other hand, he's really not a physically violent man, aside from an occasional violent temper tantrum where he might smash something random.  He also didn't want to fight in Viewnam and declared himself a pacifist and did something to avoid actually serving any duty where he MIGHT have to fight an enemy soldier face to face and see the whites of their eyes, and he of course somehow knew exactly how to make it look on paperwork and have it stick.  Paul Samuel Reeves is extremely pacifistic by nature, like a stereotypical asian monk who would never strike anyone and provoke and prank and trick someone with his methods and with words, and make someone else attack with a sword or something and look violent as well as schizoid or something.  As for Sally Lynn Reeves, she's a pacifist when it comes to anything close to physical violence, and would never spank me when I was very little yet want it done in the household [he would make dad, Eric Reeves do it], and she has no pretense to even come close to wielding anything for physical violence, and would cringe and refuse to touch a dagger that is a bit sharp for her and isn't meant for the kitchen and has blood on it, and if she had to pick it up she would cringe and pick it up with disgust, but not hesitate because she would decide that 'enough is enough' and she wants her living room floor carpet clean and tidy, and there's no way she would want the blood to dry out or make stains, even if it was LONG before company might be over [how would that make her look?].  Side note: I don't recall Paul Samuel Reeves ever owning or firing or learning how to use a firearm, or having an interest in such, or Sally Lynn Reeves for that matter.  I don't have any practical reason to think that either one of them ever did.  'nuff said.

Idea #0067:
	The Dark Queen can make any of her human vessels cry [with tears streaming down the cheeks and face, etc] upon command, including making her vessel appear distraught if she chooses to.  This applies to her vessels on planet Earth.  Elsewhere is outside the scope of this idea.

Idea #0068:
	I do not know how to socialize.  I never learned.  This is unfair in zarakite values.  I handworte those three sentences, literally and word for word, although I involuntarily ended up writing the third one with 'zarakite values' being at the end of the sentence instead of having the sentence phrased the way I wanted to, and I had no way to stop it.  I've been bullied the same way in the past, all the time, with things I handwrite, especially over the last several years, and have had no way to overcome it.  Such has also forced me to rewrite scripture as well, a number of times over the last several years, to correct bad information that someone else wanted and replace it with information that I want that should be what I handwrite instead.  This bullying was done by someone or someones who were not nearby in my physical local location/vacinity, and done by one or more hostiles who were what could easily be ten thousand miles away on this planet as well as satellites in orbit, as well as others that such aforementioned hostiles partnered with and perhaps lied to and maybe thought controlled.  Suffering from such bullying is hostile and evil when used against someone who is innocent, in zarakite values, 'nuffs said.  Suffering from such bullying is not something I ever asked for or wanted, not as Proto, and not as anyone else, including as any sky boy.  I've been told this type of thing that I've been bullied by is one form of what is called 'flummoxing' which because of another form of the same thing I've been forced to call 'flubbery', which is also just as evil in zarakite values.  A comparable form of evil I've been bullied by, which is also just as evil in zarakite values, has victimized me for years in the form of involuntary stuttering, artificial/plastic upwards bending of pitch to sound like someone with Asperger's syndrome, inablility to remember names of people as well as certain vocabulary at certain times right when I really need to remember such things, inablitily to read text and handwritings properly [reading such things and having my eyes go accross the page yet not understanding or comprehending it, and also not noticing it sometimes but not always], losing my balance and being 'pushed' sideways because of involuntary stimulation of my nerves and muscles and anatomy, amnesia and forgetfulness of things I wanted to get done as well as things I should be aware of for various reasons and also weird plastic deja vu.  Many of these things I've put up with for decades, as well as a lot of other things I'm not aware of and haven't learned, and also can't learn for various reasons, and things I shouldn't learn for various reasons [as well as but not limited to certain lessons being far too evil in nearly all justice systems and values at least in more than one universe].  Headaches are also included.

Idea #0069:
	I've been hypnotized into falling into a hypnotic pseudo-sleep against my will, repeatedly.  Such is an act of bullying.  This bullying was done by someone or someones who were not nearby in my physical local location/vacinity, and done by one or more hostiles who were what could easily be ten thousand miles away on this planet as well as satellites in orbit, as well as others that such aforementioned hostiles partnered with and perhaps lied to and maybe thought controlled.  Suffering from such bullying is hostile and evil when used against someone who is innocent, in zarakite values, 'nuffs said.  Suffering from such bullying is not something I ever asked for or wanted, not as Proto, and not as anyone else, including as any sky boy.

Idea #0070:
	I am not a decoy for any mind controller.  There's been talk about this type of thing in my head with someone's telepathy I'm not familiar with, for at least the last several years.

Idea #0071:
	I've been told that the CIA will not come out of this as heros.  I think zarakite values agree.

Idea #0072:
	I hate spitting.  I was never into such.  I was never a fan of drooling, myself and humans and other animals.  I was never a fan of related behaviors that some human bullies would do, including breathing on someone else both with and without a cloud of saliva vapor, f--ing nasty, ugh.....

Idea #0073:
	I am allowed to be arrogant.  Zarakite values allow this, and don't see this as evil.  On the other hand, there's other zarakite values as well of course, and it's not like one or more zarakite values suddenly cease to exist so I can have something both ways, conveniently and selectively on my part.  The exception to this type of thing with zarakite values, 'cherry picking' at times and in some cases deliberately misinterpreting one's own values [pulling 'cheap shots'] is sometimes referred to being 'teenager' about an issue, although the word 'teenager' used this way is more often used by public schoolteachers in Zarakite American English than it is by sky boys.

Idea #0074:
	My half zarakites will have personalities that I want.  My half zarakites will lack personalities that I don't want.  I'm saying this as Proto.

Idea #0075:
	My sex drive is a zarakite sex drive.  All sky boys have the same, and such is referred to as The Zarakite Sex Drive.  Such a sex drive [including masterbation and ejaculation of sorts] is not evil, but rather sacred and essential in zarakite values, 'nuff said.

Idea #0076:
	My sex drive has never been against any religion that I've ever had.

Idea #0077:
	Sometimes capitalized terms in Zarakite American English have the first word uncapitalized and in some cases even omitted, if the first word is 'The'.  This is not the same as Human Anmerican English.

Idea #0078:
	Capitalized Terms in Zarakite American English normally have words such as 'the' and 'of' and 'a' captilized, for proper Zarakite American English, and as long as such words are not the first word of the term this is mandatory for proper grammar.  This is not the same as Human Anmerican English.

Idea #0079:
	Schoolteachers familiar with sky boys of various clans will sometimes use the word 'ejaculatory' as an adjective, which is not TECHNICALLY considered profanity in Zarakite American English, and is also a word that sky boys recognize in their language[s].  Such schoolteachers also use the word 'penile' as a related word, which is an adjective based upon the Human American English meaning of 'penile'.  Also, such words and the word 'penis', as well as words that refer to masterbation and sex, and requests by students and instructions from schoolteachers to do such things in the classroom and in hallways in plain sight are casual and common and serious-minded, and not corrupt or illict rule-breaking things for both students as well as schoolteachers [and others that work at schools] not to mention public parks and shopping malls and in video games and entertainment culture etc.  These things are normal in Zarakite American English and sky boy culture.

Idea #0080:
	Ideas #0075, #0076, #0077, #0078, #0079, combined.

Idea #0081:
	Throughout the history of the human species, when humans - whom I sometimes diplomatically refer to as 'historicals' - would pray to any god or goddess regardless of their religion and regardless of what culture they came from, if they ever had any reply in their head to their prayers they were actually comminicating telepathically with an extraterrestrial, a sentient/intelligent being from a planet other than planet Earth.  Various exosolar beings [an 'exosolar being' is an extraterrestrial, to keep things consistent] have taken turns being a human's 'god' or divine being for humans over the millenia.

Idea #0082:
	I'm willing to try to explain and introduce various exosolar species involved, and who has suffered in what ways from evil mind controllers etc [?].
	[cloudy]

Idea #0083:
	Non-casual Zarakite American English includes phrases such as '...then make yourself absent' to mean '...then get lost [for any reason, darn near any type of context, it just works]'.

Idea #0084:
	Non-casual Zarakite American English includes phrases such as 'if you may grant me an audience...' to mean 'if you could wait and let me talk to you for a second [and actually hear me out]'.

Idea #0085:
	Non-casual Zarakite American English includes phrases such as 'I am not bemused' to mean 'I am not pleased' [to be diplomatic] or 'I'm upset at this bulls---' [to not sugar-coat it, and tell it straight, without beating around the bush].  One can also state it as 'I stand not bemused' which is very formal, when everyone in the room is an arisrocrat and surrounded by bodyguards left and right in the throne room, with foreign diplomats everywhere for one of the bigger history-making peace treaties or something [and not the bash that comes afterwards when the party balloon go up, you get the idea...].  The first part, with the word 'stand', is kind of like 'stand' in 'I stand corrected'.
	One can also say that they are 'not bemused' in a diplomatic conference to explain that they are being serious-minded and in some cases very literal, and cut through any misunderstandings because they don't speak Zarakite languages very well, and don't know the right body language, and don't appear to be taken seriously and need a way to say that.  They can also do this by adding '..., and I am not bemused', which is also like saying '..., and I'm not joking or being sarcastic, and just want to be sure we're on the same page.'  As far as whether someone is simply being serious, or ticked off as well, this varies, but either way one should be careful with a diplomat to avoid making a bad first impression with them, of course.  As such, if one is to assume that there is any implied emotion conveyed, they should assume it is negative.  They could always ask, of course.  'Were you offended?' is what could be spoken in some form.

Idea #0086:
	Non-casual Zarakite American English includes phrases such as '...grant me your counsel' to mean '...give me some advice' or '..speak with me to give me some feedback [regarding some issue]'.  If someone says in a diplomatic conversation 'I appreciate that but I did not seek your counsel [regarding that matter]' in a private diplomat-to-diplomat conversation outside of the conference room, this is one way that one diplomat can say to another who isn't from the same world ['world of origin' if you want to be picky] 'Hey, I didn't ask' or 'Hey, thanks, but I didn't ask' [the 'thanks' here is actually sarcastic, but to be polite, even if said with a bit of anger that is being held back so it simply comes out as being annoyed].  If a diplomat says 'I appreciate that but I did not seek your counsel' in a non-private setting, such as in the middle of a big meeting to negotiate a trade agreement, or maybe where two different cultures' militaries are going to mutually consider a dividing territorial common border to be [before some uniformed official asks for a 'green card' or says 'ahem, papers please...'], then the diplomat might be being formal and be politely telling someone they didn't ask for any input, but they also might be telling someone to f--- off and 'shut up' if they say it with a growl, which means of course that someone was [initially] rude with their commentary, and then the other diplomat was irratated and telling the first guy to close his mouth [and keep it that way, lest he have his clock cleaned and his a-- kicked in and bleeding profusely out the other side to be mopped up by the local housekeeping after the meeting and properly disposed of and tucked away compliant with sanitation standards in a cool dry place, use your imagination].

Idea #0087:
	Speaking of, uh, [cough], the 'colorful' side of Zarakite American English language and culture, telling someone to 'f--- off' is pretty much the same as 'giving someone a have-a-nice-day finger' or 'giving someone the [middle] finger', where in the former comparison 'have a nice day' is sarcastic and used as a euphemism for the profantiy 'f--- you' and ending up with 'giving someone a f--- you finger' which has cursing and swearing or 'cuss words', of course.  In grade school, little ones wouldn't use such a 'colorful metaphor' [swear words] with a schoolteacher in front of the class, and in junior high school it might happen once or twice in the school year and make heads turn and rumors later, and in high school things are, uh, worse, and past that in any college they don't give out detentions in the school but instead have police that call your parents, depending on the professor [like a 'schoolteacher', same thing] and how you end up doing it in his classroom.  Note that this isn't the same thing as 'pointing a blaming finger' at someone, which is a phrase a schoolteacher would use in a classroom lecture or discission, for teaching something.

Idea #0088:
	Non-casual Zarakite American English includes phrases such as 'servant of [so-and-so]' and 'one who answers to [so-and-so]' in diplomatic settings but not the classroom, unless of course the class in on a field trip to a government building and stumbled into the wrong room by complete accident when they are doing some political agreement or something.  This can be an alternative to saying 'Mister [so-and-so]'s peon' as well as 'Miss [so-and-so]'s intermediary' etc.  There's plenty of comparable variants such as 'one who answers to [so-and-so]'.
	In other words, if some king or emporer named 'Smith' sends one of his grunts to talk to you, and expects you to bow in front of him and grovel as if it was the king himself and not even think of looking at him the wrong way, much less scratching an itch at the wrong moment when he can see you do it, you would only speak when spoken to [yeah, all that sort of stuff applies here], and answer a question super-uptight and respectfully as 'Yes, servant of King Smith' or 'No, servant of King Smith' or if you forget Smith's name 'Yes it does, servant of his royal majesty'.  The nice part is that you don't have to know the name of whatever representative they sent, and it's not like the king himself would necessarily see some 'little guy' like you in person, it depends on the king's style.  [Some kings actually would hang with the local common folk in a public fast food resturaunt where everday 'John Doe' or 'Joe Citizen' types come and go, and walk and talk and order their food, and chat and mingle with other people there just like everyone else does, and yes, for sky boys, if it's a place where someone has casual sex with some boy they never met and they don't bother getting their name, the king does that too just the same, which is a no-brainer at this point, as if.]  This helps becuase you don't have to bother the guy that the king sent by asking him or her what their name is with 'to whom am I speaking?' or 'pardon me, to whom am I speaking?' which sky children as well as sky boy juveniles of all clans [?] are taught to do in school as proper manners when some authority figure in a uniform talks to you ['speak when spoken to' for any who forgot, *cough*, uh brain fart, skid marks on the back of the head, dripping down...].  Their name isn't important and is probably something you would forget anyways, and either you're blocking their path as they are walking out of a building and 'you should watch THEIR way' and stuff [some are uptight like that, not that you should do anything about it, no really, if you don't watch it with them you end up with far worse then a detention in school, your family will have a field day with you], or they are headed somewhere for something that's official government business which of course is none of your business, and you're actually getting a rare treat by having them pull up alongside you when you're on the sidewalk, and they are lost and asking for directions to the government office, if you're 'wowed' or starstruck by that sort of thing, which most sky children at least arn't used to [?].

Idea #0089:
	If something is labeled as 'cloudy', it isn't finalized, among other meanings, and one could also say it 'isn't certain' and refer to such statements with language like 'this MIGHT be correct' when calling something 'honest' or what have you, for now, and other technical stuff.....

Idea #0090:
	To 'bean someone with a stick' is loose, and doesn't usually mean literally smashing someone's skull in with a metal baseball bat and a satisfying corresponding crunching sound and accompanying relief and satisfaction of an end to a pain-in-the-a--, although it could.  Okay, Okay, to cut the nonsense and be serious, it's like a parent snapping at a child and saying '...or else' if they are from Teenage Target Culture.  If it comes from a red-faced schoolteacher from the same culture, hey, same thing.  ['Or else', not the 'bean you with a stick', I mean.  Back in Teenage Target Culture, North Olmsted school, we didn't have anyone talk like that with 'bean' or 'stick', not parents or schoolteachers, and I didn't have that in my, uh, situation either, referring to the 'growing up' and 'so to speak' that has to come with it, *cough* *cough* as if].  [Gosh, what sort of dork talks like that anyways?] [?].  [You might as well 'cue' the 'oh my, oh dear, oh s---, oh dear' thing as well, whatever all that means.....] [?].

Idea #0091:
	Ideas #0081 through #0090, as well as #0080 and #0092 and previously established stuff which still holds of course, combined.

Idea #0092:
	I don't know how to explain these ideas a better way, literally almost all of the time, and I and others are certainly not bemused.  This is something more and more are increasingly seeing is irrefutable without any of this snowballing slowing down but instead speeding up, and with aforementioned snowballing not to slow down or reverse or change direction ever.  Also, Zare wants and desires certain things, amidst/regardless-of his playfulness, I kid ya not.  There IS a casual relationship between these two concepts, believe it or not.  No really, it reminds me of one of those things with a narrative and words on the TV set at the start of an old pay-per-view movie I might record on some musty old VHS, 'The following feature presentation has: bad acting, shallow plot, pathetic actors, crackpot humor, shoestring budget, and has been rated "I" for "INSANE" by the Mentally Pathetic Disassociation of America, a stiff drink and professionally performed lobotomy is advised before viewing...'

Idea #0093:
	'Common Zarakite American English' is the most frequently spoken language by all sky boys, and is also used by such more often than any other language with wristwatches, media, and homework submitted for school.  They instinctively use it at the dinner table [?] and with their friends, juvenile and teenagers alike.  'Casual' is another word that may be used as an alternative to 'common' [?].

Idea #0094:
	Common Zarakite American English includes the word 'skin' to refer to a sky boy's 'body' including his head [skull, face, scalp, ears, etc] as well as the rest of his anatomical body parts that are in normal three-dimensional space when he is alive and living as he normally does.  Sky boys also use the word 'body' to mean the same.  Regarding hybrids [?], Zarakite American English just uses the word 'body', and uses both 'skin' and 'body' just for sky boys.  Coincidentally, Human American English also uses the word 'body' to refer to what appears to human eyes to be the same thing [for both humans and sky boys].  Other words in either species' English that mean the same as 'body' in this context arn't mentioned here either way.

Idea #0095:
	Common Zarakite American English includes the phrase 'wearing one's skin' when referring to a sky boy's head to mean that his head is attached to his skin via a neck [as opposed to holding his head in one or both of his arms, or having his head elsewhere, etc].  This is the same as referring to his skin [the rest of his anatomy beneath his head, what a human might call his 'body']
	[incomplete]

Idea #0096:
	Common Zarakite American English includes the word 'detached' to refer to a sky boy's head which is not attached to his skin.  This includes both being decapitated [ie from a swing of a sword, through one side of the neck and out the other] which typically involves blood spraying and dripping from the injury, and also includes standard detachment [any sky boy using one of their fingers in his belly button, or of course their wristwatch as an alternative].  Naturally, the meaning of 'decapitated' in Zarakite English languages is the same as it is in human English languages.  If a sky boy says 'decapitated' in Zarakite American English they do mean 'detached' as well but are being more specific, while 'detached' could be restated in a more lengthy way to be expanded into 'detached and-or decapitated' for whatever reason.  Sky boys don't normally talk that way [referring to the long version] and would just say 'detached' and sometimes 'decapitated', which 'just works' 
	[incomplete]

Idea #0097:
	Common Zarakite American English includes the word 'fouled' to refer to a sky boy's detached head that won't reattach to any skin becuase it has material in it that the sky boy would not normally eat.
	[incomplete]

Idea #0098:
	'verbage', a word for 'grammar', though sometimes 'words' or 'sentence structure' work if alternatives are sought.  'Legalese' is a type of 'verbage'.  'Poetry' is another.  ['Poetry is a dressed-up and flowery way of saying something' is how I would describe poetry, if someone were to ask me what the word means, referring to language that has some characteristic artistic style start-to-finish that is over-my-head and brain-melting as I see it, too much for my juvenile little featherhead brains to actually read properly much less understand.  Some might say 'read and enjoy'.  No offense, but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting long enough to get to the 'enjoy' part]
	[incomplete]

Idea #0099:
	Seperation of identity, all heads of a multi-zarakite are still the same zarakite and the same identity, an identity which happens to have multiple minds, yet is referred to by self and others with both plural and singular interchangeably in many ways, to avoid clumsy grammer
	[incomplete]

Idea #0100:
	Tethering does not involve time travel.  The flow of time in Twinskye is parallel to the flow of time where sky boys live, and moves at the same speed and same direction as time where the skins and heads of all sky boys normally live and where planet Earth is, constant and consistent.

Idea #0101:
	Apparent slowing of time, some sky boys might do so in ways that don't do anything magical or esoteric, and certainly don't alter space or time, or do any other meddling of such things that are easily unsafe and dangerous.  If any sky boys do this, they probably have some ablility to temporarily slow down their perception of how fast time normally moves forward by having their brains work faster and more efficiently and as such do so in ways that only affect things from their point of view, one or more brains and minds, and don't actually alter the rate of time passing in any real life, and someone else watching a sky boy doing this would observe and witness time moving forward normally, and might not understand or notice what the sky boy is doing, but might watch the sky boy simply have apparently lightning-fast reactions and reflexes, and possibly not know how the sky boy does something like that, which makes sense of course [to myself as well as all sky boys of all years of age, and others as well that are intelligent and not infected by evils].

Idea #0102:
	If sky boys steal something, they steal something that they would leave in a safe or chest with a good padlock.  Like other ideas that are written this way, this is presumed to be a proper and logical example of how sky boys behave consistent with their values.

Idea #0103:
	If sky boys steal something in an act of evil, and they want to get away with it, they hide what they stole.  If they can't find what they would think would be a good hiding place, they would probably disguise it, and also try to avoid drawing attention to it, and also avoid making it [what they stole, duh] the subject of conversation.  They [the sky boy] might also try some combination of pretending that it [the stolen property] wasn't stolen, allowing others to just assume it belongs to them [the sky boy thief of course] initially, and in other cases simply get away with the theft if no one asks [as mentioned].  Also, sky boys naturally understand that the longer it could be identified as 'stolen property' or something that doesn't belong to them, the greater the risk they will get in trouble.
	[incomplete]

Idea #0104:
	Sky boys naturally understand that if they can't tolerate ['put up with' in Zarakite American English, same as Human American English of course] a punishment for breaking a rule, they shouldn't break that rule.  As long as a sky boy has heard of and understands whatever rule it is as well as the punishment, he is going to tend to not break that rule.  This type of motivation to avoid breaking such a rule is called a 'deterrent' and of course has the same meaning
	[incomplete]

Idea #0105:
	'Can I use the bathroom' is what a sky boy would probably say in Zarakite American English if they are asking someone if it is okay to use a nearby toilet [room], to 'spray' or 'jack off' in, or have sex or milk someone, etc.  'May I use the bathroom' is what a picky and uptight female [human?] schoolteacher might expect [demand, snapping at her student] and carefully train and educate her students accordingly to say in her classroom [whacking you with a stick like in finishing school that can crush and smash bones with a loud crunching noise, and send blood spraying then dripping from walls and ceiling, like 'finishing school in hell' as a human might put it].  'May I use the bathroom' is also something I'd tell a human to use if talking to someone who's being a 'little miss Queen Of England' about it, but not to her face or within earshot of her of course.  In grade school, I'd imagine that saying that to another student is probably going to be enough that they understand that Mrs [whatever] who teaches second grade in the back of the school [or whereever] is 'one of those' types of human schoolteachers.  Look, if a teacher says 'I don't know, can you?' if I ask to go 'pee' or something down the hallway, that hits me off guard, and leads me to ask if she understands whether or not I'm anatomically capable of making or allowing myself to pee or spray or something in a bathroom, or if I know how to use my penis, or if I need a book of instructions, or if I'm shape-shifted into a form that has the necessary physical parts and components to do such a thing with a urinal or not.  No really, I kid you not, this stuff started in grade school, and led to a back-and-forth conversation, not bemused, between me and a female human schoolteacher that would sputter and stall, screeching to a halt, akward for both me and the teacher mutually.  It got weird and difficult every time it happened, I wasn't prepared for her to say 'I don't know, can you?' and she wouldn't be prepared for my reaction to that, and we all know about the how we wouldn't be psychic or anything and all that stuff and pretend for the messed up computers and whatever, but anyways, I think I had this happen with more than one teacher in grade school.  [In the grade school I went to, we always had the same schoolteacher the entire year, and did everything in the same classroom, for most stuff, except phys ed and a few special classes, and I was also in a 'gifted and talented' program for students who were intelligent and have an IQ of 140 or 150 or something as human 'experts' and Sally herself said, etc, in Herndon VA].

Idea #0106:
	If someone is suffering painfully, like being tarred and feathered and nailed to something and set on fire and burning long and HARD, perhaps being so darn vilified and guilty beyond belief, its obviously less painful and far less unpleasant for that someone to have their punishment 'over and done with' sooner rather than later so that they don't suffer as much almighty pain.

Idea #0107:
	If someone is guilty to the point that they are suffering a very long-term punishment that is very slow and just brutal, this isn't necessarily proper justice, and in fact can be more evil than good as a collective end-result because of how much work it takes to punish someone for so long, and even more so if their punishment is blocking [as in 'preventing'] others who are innocent from being saved or rescued from suffering.  Jail for prisoners who really do some hard time can be expensive on planet Earth, and cost money and prison staff time and work to maintain walls and ceilings and food on a daily for a worthless heap of a being that is a waste of air, when other beings on planet Earth could be breathing THAT AIR, not to mention humans who at least get this stuff right, and are upset as they mention 'taxpayer money' and other stuff.  It is said by the Dark King himself that even humans eventually figured out [but still tried anyways over the ages] that a simple system of 'Why have all those courts and lawyers?  If he's guilty of something, just shoot him' doesn't really work very well, despite what human governments tried throughout the millenia.

Idea #0108:
	I've heard others say that victimizing one who is very young, a youth, is just 'criminal' any way you slice it, hurting and bullying someone who never had a chance.  I've also heard that 'baby killer' really does turn heads and anger humans and motivate them to want justice, and want blood, and want it right away.  Look, I didn't invent these concepts, but they are real life to begin with, and just how life works, and still are, no matter what universe that I've ever heard of one comes from.  Zarakite values just agree, one hundred percent, no need to think about it or justify it, or discuss it usually, its just one of those 'given' concepts that just makes common sense, that even the mentally ill that I've heard of just understand.  I don't see there being any exceptions to that, and neither do zarakite values, ever.

Idea #0109:
	Bad guys [those who break rules, break laws, and steal in school, also bullies, etc] often get away with being evil and breaking rules, and often never get caught, and as such 'get away with it'.  This happens with humans all the time in their civilizations and cultures on planet Earth, and is stuff I grew up watching and witnessing, including myself as a victim of such things.  It's part of what has been real life for humans, and has been getting worse, and killing their species increasingly with each generation, from what I've witnessed over and over again.  This type of thing is also evil according to zarakite values, and with it happening more with every generation of humans, is overall increasingly evil according to zarakite values, parallel and directly correlated.

Idea #0110:
	According to zarakite values, when a human is missing something that they were expecting to find in their home, and they don't find it where they expect it, they probably misplaced it, and they probably didn't have it stolen.  That and if they claim or whine that it was supposedly 'stolen' they are jumping to conclusions, as well as being childish, and impractical, and what I call illogical as well as bad.  If they do it all the time I would say that such a human is mentally ill, and I would also say that they wouldn't survive in the real world, and are too sick to survive natural selection.  If they don't survive natural selection, which means they can't live and can't take care of themself long enough to become old enough to have kids that are also infected and delusional and mentally ill just the same, that's a good thing according to zarakite values, becuase the greater majority of their species doesn't have to put up with their genetics or offspring perpetuating or spreading among their species.  As such, their species doesn't suffer as much, their species doesn't have as many delusional childish individuals that would never survive and shouldn't survive, and also the few who become delusional like that die off and no one has to put up with them or how messed up they are, and the rest of the people in civilization are normal and healthy, and survive quite nicely, which is why zarakite values say that such natural selection to weed out such evil is a GOOD thing, as zarakite values take into account the majority and the whole of the entire civilization, and account for all civilizations, and account for all civilizations in this manner where all members of all populations are considered.  This all just makes practical common sense, undeniable and irrefutable and unbreakable.  Zarakite values agree, have agreed, and still do, and will agree, literally end to end.

Idea #0111:
	'go ahead, knock yourself out', Zarakite American English meaning and how it's the same as Human American English that Teenage Target Culture used and uses, this one's a no-brainer
	[incomplete]

Idea #0112:
	'go ahead, laugh it up', Zarakite American English meaning and how it can be the same as Human American English and what a common healthy human being of the majority and masses not too mention Teenage Target Culture would think it means, this one isn't hard for such a human to get, either
	[incomplete]

Idea #0113:
	fighting entropy, more work being put into maintaining something until it just isn't worth it anymore, and the payoff from the same amount of work gets smaller and smaller, or an exponentially greater amount of work is needed to accomplish the same amount of work, and the less common sense is had, and the less sky boys will put up with it, first ripping on you and calling you a moron, then enforcing measures to put a stop to your stupid s---, thank f---.
	[incomplete]

Idea #0114:
	Every sky boy has 'their dragon' referring to their sex drive
	That dragon always has cravings
	Usually it lets a sky boy's head brain call the shots
	A sky boy's spirit [sense of self, some human religions call it a 'soul' I guess, sense of self that has free will and actual mind] can only live in a head brain of their anatomy, usually the head [skull] and other minds seem to have their own spirit [sky boys say 'it has a mind of it's own' referring to one of such] but are incomplete without their spirit, other minds of a sky boy are always aware of where their spirit is including when a sky boy is alive and has more than one part of his anatomical body parts living and getting around and doing stuff [multi-headed zarakites especially are used to this all the time as real life, with more than one head and more than one skin that is themself simultaneously yet only one can of course have his spirit in some body part usually a head but can also be part of his skin]
	The 'penile mind' that all sky boys have is a seperate mind than the head mind and is never a mind that has his spirit in it
	A sky boy has one penile mind and one head brain for every skin
	A sky boy has one penile mind and one head brain for every head
	A sky boy that can wear wings has one head brain etc for every skin [?] which is never where his spirit can 'live' or 'be' just like any penile mind
	A sky boy who is a multiheaded zarakite has seperate minds for all of his 'heads' and 'head' in this case refers to more than just a skull and scalp etc but entire head-to-toe anatomy [a head and neck and arms and legs and torso and wings and hand etc, in other words what looks like an entire common single-headed zarakite, except that what looks like to an outside observer as multiple independent zarakites as totally different dragon sky boys is actually the same dragon sky boy, and his spirit can hop around between his various 'selves' or 'heads and bodies' or 'heads and skins', and zarakites with more than one head have an independent legal name for each of their heads, yet simultaneously they also share the same mutual legal identity and answer to the name the primary head does, so if a two-headed dragon finds out his 'second head' as in 'secondary head' which is its own skull and brainpan and own torso and arms and legs etc, gets a detention in school, then both his primary and secondard heads, which look like two seperate dragon sky boys that might or might not know each other but have the same face from The Book Of Faces to an outside observer in the same room or whatever, both heads are in trouble and must serve punishment in detention as they are legally and culturally considered the same single sky boy even though in some cases they are spoken of and thought of simultaneously as two seperate boys who are not necessarily the same people, varies, this isn't really that confusing or difficult for non-psychic common and everyday human beings to understand, and each of a multi-headed zarakites individual 'selves' has their own wallet and ID which all have both their shared common name as well as their individual names, and again the shared name is the same as the primary head's individual legal name, which includes first and middle and last names and what would be on a birth cirtificate and what they would use to sign up for or register for something on paper as well as vote at the polls when their might be some election if they do such things etc]
	A sky boy who isn't wearing his head, maybe he has his head detached and his skin is walking around carrying his head, is still legally considered one single boy and one legal identity with the same shared name, this applies to the kids too, as sky children can't vote twice with their head and their skin seperate, and if they stand in line twice and leave their head behind with friends one of those two times they still only SHOULD get service just once if that's what everyone who stands in line is supposed to get and 'no seconds' or 'no refills, you have to buy another' is some policy that applies etc
	People who work at the door to admit someone to a theme park and take tickets from someone in line, or at a rock concert, as well as stuff in high schools and fast food places etc, are used to tomfoolery and goofing off where sky boys including the sky children try to pass as seperate boys by using detachables and not having their heads attached at times, and related pranks, etc, and policies to deal with that type of stuff, yet pretty much all sky boys pull such stunts from time to time anyways and always try to come up with new creative ideas for how to do that and get away with it, after all they learn stuff like this in public school even before high school, and are actually encouraged to do so and train to do it in some cases, referring to dragon sky boys in particular, as they use it when hunting and fighting and policing sky children and dealing with monsters and creatures in the wild and enemy soldiers and related adventures and military operations, and also in times of peace when there isn't war they practice these things with the sky children in large outdoor playgrounds where they swordfight and play with each other and dismember and decapitate each other over and over again and leave severed and discarded body parts to become shape-shifting worms for planet Earth and Earth's nature which all sky boys are part of and belong to
	One single detached or cut off hand from any sky boy shape-shifts into numerous countless shape-shifting worms that vary depending on climate and terrain and what the hand was on top of to begin with [grass? dirt? and oil spill?  pollution?  clean dirt that already is healthy and grows nice healthy tall and GREEN grass?  polluted dirty dirt and soil that barely has anything but sickly unhealthy grass that won't grow very well and leads to disease and famine among herbivores and wildlife that deserve better?]  Such worms have magical blood in them that glow just the same if injured or cut open, yet do good for the life and nature that they are part of and belong to, as established in past ideas and imaginations and wants of Zare for sky boys and zarakites and hybrids and what humans turn into, sky children and 'ancients' as well, even if some of them unfortunately have to have a 'flat front' instead of washboard abs, which frustrates and angers and hurts Zare of SkyCrowne as he really didn't want certain humans do become so d--- evil and dedicate themselves to such evil madness, yikes, when will it end?  And they called ME 'belligerent'?  Okay, as someone suggested, 'It's called "insanity", and I agree, but that doesn't make me feel better, even though I'm sure I'll just have to take their word for it, ugh.....'  Honestly, some humans have such outrageous intellects, I just can't wrap my head around why the ---- they would ever do such things and refuse to have any hint of common sense, beyond belief.  The best I'm stuck with is good advice from a police officer, a human who gave me really good advice about how real life works sometimes, when I'm baffled and stuck and just can't get over certain humans who are so illogical and so evil, not to mention insane, 'Dave, you're trying to make sense out of something that don't make no sense' with an implied non-spoken '...so don't bother, or you'll just hurt your brain, don't try to "get it" because you're looking at a lost cause that will leave you frustrated and in brain-melting PAIN and never get anything done' except he never had to get extraneous and talk like that, and we just understood each other, and he seemed to just know how to talk to me, straight up and simple, in a way like that that I just understood him, and he was a common ordinary human police officer as I recall, not like he had to use sign language or a magic wand or anything to do it, he would talk to me like he would another ordinary common human being and it would just work, the short version without having to give me the long one, simple yet logical.  He's a really good man as I recall, a good cop but also a good human, also a father with his own human children, and plenty of experience talking to kids and teenagers, collegiate and high school and stuff, who knows what he's doing.  *cough*, honor guard.....

Idea #0115:
	I have no interest and no desire to prosecute or have prosecuted Sally Lynn Reeves in any human species court of law regarding any victimization of myself specifically, and this includes both civil court as well as criminal court and any derivitave of criminal court that any common man would not have heard of.  Arbritrators such as Judge Judy's television show as well as ones that are not televised or published for entertainment also need not apply.  [Yup, the real ones as well as the fake ones that are for show.]

Idea #0116:
	I bought plenty of jars of concentrated stevia as it quickly became a sweetener I really like, more so than sugar, ever since the first time I tried it.  That I eventually ended up using the left-over empty jars for paints etc in my guitar-refinishing home workshop is beside the point, and I did the same with coffee cans and eggshell cartons I would buy stuff I'd cook with and eat [the eggs, not the egg cartons they were sold in, granted I've never tried cooking egg cartons as well as the eggs for baking or scrambled eggs or anything.  Look, I like to try new foods, and I have the approach of 'How do you know you won't like it if you don't try it', but, uh, there are limits to that value.....  Let's just say that there might be, just maybe, a related reason I've never tried cooking dog fecal matter in my kitchen, and I wouldn't even experiment with that the first time, thank you.  Yeah, there are humans who do that sort of thing, and even put it on Youtube, but to be fair you're talking about a handful that's a small obnoxious and attention-getting minority, and there's only about seven to eight billion of them total, and thats just the recent figures, they've been around for millions of years, and I don't remember any culture coming up in history class in school that made a big cultural 'normal thing' about eating poop, with any civilization of humans, ever, not even the history classes where they admitted that Alexander The Great was a homosexual and they don't put that kind of stuff in most history books.  Try that for a frame of reference, I rest my case.]

Idea #0117:
	Low blood pressure issues, syncope, tilt table tests with cardiologists, multiple cardiologists regarding low blood pressure and Florinef among other medications and prescription salt tablets which were not always on the market, orthostatic hypotenstion for such a long history that I can spell 'orthostatic hypotension' by heart and could do so for years and learned to do that all by myself, and doctors in grade school days as well as pediatricians in Ohio also knew about and long documented LOW blood pressure and special diet, passing out from low blood pressure has happened before, long history of such, and yes it is rare and not like high blood pressure which is a far more frequent and common issue with human beings and cardiologists, and I already knew this and explained this to numerous guides over and over and over again including when I still had an apartment and a car and something of a life etc, and current doctors of all kinds as well as nurses are going to look outrageously stupid as well well as unprofessional and evil and irresponsible very blatantly in ways that quickly make very attention-getting paper trails that quickly threaten their medical credentials if they buck me on this and how these things are all very real for decades, need I mention 'credibility' and 'no-brainer' as well as 'physical evidence' in the same sentence along with how such would be very public and isn't subject to any secrecy or discretion and is very attention getting in very simple non-esoteric ways that even ordinary majority-population human mothers and families from the masses recognize and pick up on very quickly and DO recognize?  Hey, these things are real, and are fact, and are a bit difficult to ignore and pretend don't exist and never did, and would be like pretending hospitals of ALL kinds never existed and there is hypothetically no such thing as a doctor or medical chart or medication anywhere on the planet and supposedly no one on the planet has ever heard of such things [you're talking a pretty HARD hitting mass delusion here, one with all eight billion humans on the entire planet simultaneously as well as sustained and permanent and long term, plus with all the humans already intertwined in something medical, how would you accomplish something like that overnight with all the massive ripping and shearing involved of reality.  Look, I know about anti-aliasing and low-pass filters with digital music and songwriting and stuff, but that won't help in such a screwball hypothetical.  If the planet were to slam into Venus next door, one can't just say 'Oh, it'll be fine and so will all the life forms, all ya need is a roll of duck tape and some staples.  What?  Not good enough?  Fine, get some d--- Elmer's glue or something, do I have to think of everything?']  Note that I also have a big history of drinking and consuming caffeine in large amounts more for my kind and coincidentally lethal for a human being, which many doctors have been aware of for many years, also with a long history with paper trails and evidence and open face-to-face non-secretive non-esoteric discussions with Doctor Wiess a long-time doctor, also Doctor Shechter another long-time doctor, over the years, who were well aware of how I'd manage things with caffiene, including before and after high school, and didn't have concerns as I recall about me drinking large amounts of caffiene on a daily basis for many years but instead there were concerns about groceries and how Diet Mountain Dew is a bit expensive when it comes to shopping for groceries when being practical and looking at how much I would drink on a regular basis over many years, sustained, four cans every breakfast, more throughout the day, the 'Code Red' was something I really got into, they had their own version of diet, I also asked for Jolt Cola and 'mom' would go out to a convenience store in North Olmsted and have them special order large cases of the stuff frequently, we did that for a while, over at least a few years as I remember, and I got to become familiar with their diet versions and other flavors of Jolt cola etc.  Oh, and then there's Parmesan cheese, even before I learned to cook my own pasta and rice, and human friends and-or whatever ['Hey, Dave, want any pasta with your cheese?' and with rice, uh, same thing.....].  Good thing I always liked the taste of Mountain Dew both regular and Code Red, both diet and regular versions of both [four total], as well as Jolt cola.  As for coffee, always drank it for the buzz, and unless you want it wimpy like humans make it, you need a lot of milk [of some sort] and sweeteners, also various flavors help, sometimes even whipped cream, all sorts of stuff I won't list here as it would be a list a mile long.  My old boss the Sgt had quite an experience, as when I worked for him I could rag on him in the office for drinking 'wimpy coffee' and get away with it, and drink it like how I would make it, right in front of him.  He actually took it rather well as I see it, most human law enforcement with a gold badge arn't used to that type of thing from an employee that appears to be a human.

Idea #0118:
	Narcoleptics do sometimes pass out during meals, and wake up later, whether they want such or not, it's involuntary.  Narcolespy is not a psychiatric disorder, well verified and backed by numerous doctors and professionals world-wide on planet Earth for a long time, such is public information that is backed by their credentials and lacking secrecy, for years, both psychiatrists as well as neurologists and various sleep doctors from many cultures who publish the same data for the masses for all human beings inside and outside the USA, who would verify and back up this as fact with their own credentials and reputations including professional and inside and outside courtrooms [and laready have over the years, in cases that have been public and not secretive], all well within long-established and well-ingrained pretense and common knowledge among various medical professionals and families of narcoleptics.  Hey, I didn't invent narcoloepsy, or create these things, I just studied what was already here on this planet, all over the Internet and easily found in any public library, and easily common knowledge for many human families, it not like any of this stuff was top secret or restricted over the years and decades.  Anyone who tries to rebut or refuse this information is going to look pretty stupid, and very quickly, not to mention delusional if they push their rebuttal into any courtroom or doctor's office, anywhere on this planet Earth, not to mention any psychologist's office and any social worker, anywhere, becuase there have been a lot who wanted that stuff brought up again.  That and why was there a Haldeman who spoke to me and said 'I want you on psychiatry planet' and was speaking to an immortal who never asked for such things and was clueless and had no idea what was going on and wasn't allowed a chance?  What was all that about?  Psychiatry doesn't belong on this planet or in this universe, of course.  Zare of SkyCrowne and zarakite values both agree with me, as already long established, and as already consistent, and invariable the entire time, and still honest, and honest the same in any Future Focus Of Destiny.

Idea #0119:
	I hate psychiatry and always have.  Also, Zare of SkyCrown invariably hates psychiatry as well and wouldn't even use it against his most hated enemies, not even psychic ones, ever.  Zarakite values agree.  So does Zarakite Law and of course SkyCrowne.  Proto never would have wanted psychiatry, ever, not even for his enemies, and didn't know very much about these things.  Also, Paul S Reeves favored the idea of psychiatry for enemies and using related methods against enemy combatants in times of both war and peace as well as in political circles to be used for various reasons.  Paul S Reeves was always a proponent of such things over the years, as well as inducing amnesia and sleep and sleep-related hypnosis that replace the memories of others and one's self, and also inducing delusions amongst ones own and political opponents and competitors, creating confusion and delusion everywhere, and presenting himself as a pacifist, the whole time being deceptive, lies and manipulation everywhere, and always tight-lipped and secretive about it.

Idea #0120:
	There are two forms of arrogance found in sky boy culture that are among dragon sky boys.  Both are culturally acceptable when done the right way.  [This is much like parking a vehicle somewhere.  Done under the right circumstances, such is normal.  Done the wrong way, illicit.  Note that illicit means the same in Zarakite American English as it does in Human American English, which includes but isn't limited to what is illigal as well as rule-breaking, which of course invovles what is and isn't 'culturally acceptable' as some would call it, duh.  Also note that 'culturally acceptable' isn't neccesarily how a phrase that a sky boy would use of course.]  One form of aforementioned arrogance is natural, and comes with one's personality, and is found in all sky boys, even the kids.  ['Even the kids' in this case refers to sky children.]  The other form of said [aforementioned] arrogance is deliberate, and employed as a tactic, sometimes used as part of strategy in diplomacy.  Sometimes this latter form of arrogance means deliberately being arrogant and not being careful in behavior, and other times this type of arrogance is deciding not to hold back one's natural arrogance.

Idea #0121:
	Sky boys don't favor human language terms that revolve around 'health careers' as humans have called them, and don't like to talk like that with their sky boy languages [such as Sky Boy American English].

Idea #0122:
	Sky boys don't favor human language terms that revolve around 'psychology' as humans have called it, and don't like to talk like that with their sky boy languages [such as Sky Boy American English].

Idea #0123:
	Sky boys don't favor human language terms that revolve around 'espionage' as humans have called it, and don't like to talk like that with their sky boy languages [such as Sky Boy American English].

Idea #0124:
	Sky boys don't favor human language terms that revolve around 'politics' as humans have called it, and don't like to talk like that with their sky boy languages [such as Sky Boy American English].

Idea #0125:
	'If you don't kill them they get stronger' is something that is characteristic of the dark hearted as well as beings that zarakite values see as both evil and hostile.  Such was also characteristic of all three of the dark trio yet a massively downscaled version of it that even fit within tiny confines of civilized and non-violent human behavior that not even a human police officer might sometimes notice.

Idea #0126:
	Zare of SkyCrown is for certain well aware of and would back Ideas #0121 through #0124, and probably #0125 as well, combined.

Idea #0127:
	Zare of SkyCrown is for certain well aware of and would back Ideas #0121 through #0124, combined.

Idea #0128:
	Tethering is how Brain Thomas SwiftWing, to call a half zarakite [and half human, which I'm saying among other things because this is personal and family, and these CIA a--holes are still blackmailing me, fuckers.....] by his future name, rather than use is human name he has now of course, understands it.  He has this understanding at least when asleep, thanks to help from another universe that can be reached in three dimensional space from my home world of planet Earth [the same that Brain SwiftWing is from].  I would like for him to be able to understand and handle it when he's awake as well, and think about it at any time and not freak out and still work any career job he's worked at in the past, and not have to get fired or have other issues, or have problems with his human family and friends, and I would like for him to be able to handle such easily and without it being too much stress to the point where he can have some sort of normalcy he's okay with and not end up being at wit's end any more than he would before he ever heard of zarakites or sky boys or sky dragons etc, the same for other Originals that are going to be sky boys [details unspecified as such is typed like a TigerStone faced zarakite might, presumed].  Of course another universe can only do so much, geez.  I don't want to get into any talk about how real life works with any psychological self-help crap, I'm not into giving speeches in front of an audience or pep talks either, I hate that stuff and so does Zare, not to mention TigerStone personalities, that stuff is f---in' NASTY, ugh.

Idea #0129:
	Dragon sky boys cannot be soft on traitors.  Being lenient on traitors and backstabbing acts of betrayal is far too dangerous as well as unbelieveably and unforgivably evil beyond belief.  Zarakite values easily agree, quick and practical, and so does Zare [likely for all time I think].  Brian SwiftWing and his exosolar help would know more.  The same with at least some other Originals I think.

Idea #0130:
	When Paul SwiftWing [Paul Akamu SwiftWing, a half zarakite] and other half dragons like him take off their whites, their skin is a bit darker than most half dragons that arn't wearing their normal skin color.  This is normal for zarakites and half zarakites with a Volcano face [Face #54 from The Book Of Faces] [This is because of the natural skin color of Original 053 and his Hawaiian ancestry of course].  Close to the same is true of

Idea #0131:
	When using Google, typing 'wiki' and then a space before what you are looking for, defaults to wikipedia
	[incomplete]

Idea #0132:
	One should not betray their own nature.

Idea #0133:
	One should not normally betray their own kind.

Idea #0134:
	Human castration is not an invention of the dark trio, but is dark hearted [irregardless/anyways].

Idea #0135:
	Exosolar-style of literacy is found in textbooks and academic settings, but not casual language that is internal to sky boys [from one sky boy to another].

Idea #0136:
	Exosolar-style language is not normally spoken out-loud, except for certain acadmic purposes [in public schools etc] and technical reasons.  This even applies to reading out-loud something printed or typed in exosolar format.

Idea #0137:
	Swallowing semen [ejaculated from a human or any other Earth-origin life] orally is disgusting, as well as evil, according to both SkyCrown and zarakite values.

Idea #0138:
	Sky boys cannot ejaculate semen.  They are both technically and biologically incapable of doing so.  This has nothing to do with whether or not they have any penis.

Idea #0139:
	Both the smell and taste of semen (material ejaculated from a male gender Earth-origin life form which contains sperm) is disgusting to any TigerStone faced boy, and easily makes any TigerStone faced boy gag.

Idea #0140:
	Sky boys who have sex with a human male normally have their penis inside-out and swallow their sexual partner's semen as part of having sex.  The sky boy penis goes inside-out so that they can have sex even though both individuals are male, and no rectal-penetration [anyone's penis being up anyone's anus/butthole/rectum] is involved at all as part of the experience between the two individuals, and also so that both individuals having sex with each other are facing each other while having sex and also touching each other pelvis-to-pelvis and torso-to-torso.

Idea #0141:
	Sky boys often have their head tilted to one side during sex, and so does their sex partner, as sky boys don't ever kiss and would also not tolerate their partner kissing them.  Other times a sky boy would have their nose or part of their face against their partner they are having sex with, but without any kissing of course, as it is common knowledge that sky boys don't kiss and also don't put up with their partner kissing them, no way.  Sky boys also have sex with their partner's head turned and facing sideways etc, and sometimes have their own head turned to one side partway or all the way as well during sexual intercourse.  Sky boys also don't mind either them or their partner having their face against their partner's neck or torso as needed, as sometimes one of them is taller than the other.  Sky boy's also sometimes choose to not have their head attached while having sex, and just feel the physical sensation of ejaculation while detached, thanks to tethering which is how sky boy detachables work.  This is of course done for practical reasons.

Idea #0142:
	Humans often lie to Proto when it comes to face-to-face conversations, and often say very little good information to him, and the information that is spoken is frequently either misleading, or useless.  In many cases, it is both.  Humans will however turn to each other and give each other very serious and very useful information that isn't vague or synmbolic, and really is informative and useful in a practical manner.  This forces Proto to eavesdrop on conversations between each other for useful information to get answers to anything, quick and simple and information that just works, and forces Proto to be nosy and damn near spy on humans.  Regarding the specific humans that do this sort of thing, this almost always includes humans that Proto never met and-or never got to know.

Idea #0143:
	SkyCrowne does not allow any being with a drop of zarakite dragon blood in them to deliberately kill any non-sentient feline creature of planet Earth in origin, in any world ['Deliberately' of course includes setting one's self up to 'have to' kill such a feline, doof].  If up against a wall, SkyCrowne says 'let the cat win'.  Even Collecting any part of the carcass of a dead cat is a bad idea because a sky boy might have to explain what they're doing.

Idea #0144:
	Zarakite values treasure all felines of all species and sub-species of such as sacred, applicable to planet Earth in origin.

Idea #0145:
	Some humans are easy to turn into a hybrid.  Those humans are easy for a dragon sky boy to sting, and don't take as much [magic points or mundane practice with using magic, maybe both] [?].  [The time it takes to make a human into a hybrid will vary due to indirect reasons of course.] [?]  Other humans are really difficult, and lead to more than one dragon sky boy taking turns plunging their penis into a human, one after another to have sex but also sting at the same time.  If there arn't enough dragon sky boys available with enough to make it happen, the dragon boys usually try anyways and end up jacking themselves out, because if they fail the human doesn't survive if they are just left there without mutating all the way, as their half-shape-shifted anatomy from a half-baked stinging isn't functional for very long.  The personality they have to begin with makes a difference.  In some cases a guy in high school can be a real dork and the dragon boys in class had no idea, and they find they are in for a surprise as they have to get their friends to join in and really jack, HARD, like one wouldn't believe, before the twerp gets up on his feet and starts to learn the ropes of being a hybrid after the dragon boys take a break first.

Idea #0146:
	Not wanting to be evil is itself not an evil thing [at least in a simplistic sense within the same values] and this is in zarakite values [as well as other value systems which is presumed of course].

Idea #0147:
	I am a better choice for being in charge of all of the human species and whatever they turn into when compared with Sally Lynn Reeves by simple majority [fifty percent or greater majority] if one were to ask the entire human species and see to it each human understands and remembers all the information about myself as well as Sally Lynn Reeves.

Idea #0148:
	I am a better choice for being in charge of all of the human species and whatever they turn into when compared with Paul Samuel Reeves by simple majority [fifty percent or greater majority] if one were to ask the entire human species and see to it each human understands and remembers all the information about myself as well as Paul Samuel Reeves.

Idea #0149:
	I am a better choice for being in charge of all of the human species and whatever they turn into when compared with Martin Eric Reeves by simple majority [fifty percent or greater majority] if one were to ask the entire human species and see to it each human understands and remembers all the information about myself as well as Martin Eric Reeves.

Idea #0150:
	All sky boy technology, which is also called zarakite technology, is powered by magic, specifically zarakite magic, and depletes magic points over time from all sky boys who use such technology.  Sky boys deplete magic points from growing things out of gloves, shape-shifting to attach and remove detachables as well as severed parts, shape shift and operate stuff they hold and create with their gloves, spray etc with any penis they have attached, other shape-shifting they are able to do, sex and other penile stuff, give birth to other sky boys, shape-shift someone else via stinging, sting for any reason, ejaculate one's self across a field of grass or across a room etc, change their body artwork in any way, as well as just stand still.  Standing still uses up magic points over time in the same general way that humans use up their nutritional reserves that need to be replenished from ingesting food.

Idea #0151:
	Humans cannot be skeptical about the existance of mind controllers from various worlds and various realms as such would be too dangerous.  On the other hand it might be bad to have mass panic on planet Earth etc.

Idea #0152:
	Mandated by destiny, I may never have any future [reality and otherwise] where I am a disembodied brain in the hands of any human being.

Idea #0153:
	Mandated by destiny, I may never have any future [reality and otherwise] where I am a disembodied brain.  This is subject to fact-checking.

Idea #0154:
	For humans, being deaf is not necessarily mental illness, at least not in itself, and if a human is deaf one should not assume that they [the aforementioned hypothetical human] is mentally ill or mentally disabled, by soldier class [law enforcement and-or military regardless of race/species] or by anyone else.

Idea #0155:
	For Earth-origin sentient life, being deaf is not necessarily mental illness, at least not in itself, and if an intelligent life form of planet Earth in origin is deaf one should not assume that they [the aforementioned hypothetical life form that is of a species that originates from planet Earth] is mentally ill or mentally disabled, by soldier class [law enforcement and-or military regardless of race/species] or by anyone else.

Idea #0156:
	For sky boys, being deaf is not necessarily mental illness, at least not in itself, and if a sky boy is deaf one should not assume that they [the aforementioned hypothetical sky boy] is mentally ill or mentally disabled, by soldier class [law enforcement and-or military regardless of race/species] or by anyone else.

Idea #0157:
	For dragon sky boys, being deaf is not necessarily mental illness, at least not in itself, and if a dragon sky boy is deaf one should not assume that they [the aforementioned hypothetical dragon sky boy] is mentally ill or mentally disabled, by soldier class [law enforcement and-or military regardless of race/species] or by anyone else.

Idea #0158:
	For dragon boys, being deaf is not necessarily mental illness, at least not in itself, and if a dragon boy is deaf one should not assume that they [the aforementioned hypothetical dragon boy] is mentally ill or mentally disabled, by soldier class [law enforcement and-or military regardless of race/species] or by anyone else.

Idea #0159:
	For sky boys of draco nature, being deaf is not necessarily mental illness, at least not in itself, and if a draco sky boy is deaf one should not assume that they [the aforementioned hypothetical sky boy] is mentally ill or mentally disabled, by soldier class [law enforcement and-or military regardless of race/species] or by anyone else.  Note that this may be an inaccurate and-or improper way of describing such.

Idea #0160:
	For zarakites, being deaf is not necessarily mental illness, at least not in itself, and if a zarakite is deaf one should not assume that they [the aforementioned hypothetical zarakite] is mentally ill or mentally disabled, by soldier class [law enforcement and-or military regardless of race/species] or by anyone else.

Idea #0161:
	For half zarakites, being deaf is not necessarily mental illness, at least not in itself, and if a half zarakite is deaf one should not assume that they [the aforementioned hypothetical half zarakite] is mentally ill or mentally disabled, by soldier class [law enforcement and-or military regardless of race/species] or by anyone else.

Idea #0162:
	For hybrids [sky boy hybrids] [?], being deaf is not necessarily mental illness, at least not in itself, and if a hybrid is deaf one should not assume that they [the aforementioned hypothetical hybrid] is mentally ill or mentally disabled, by soldier class [law enforcement and-or military regardless of race/species] or by anyone else.

Idea #0163:
	For human vessels, being deaf [referring to the vessel] is not necessarily mental illness [of the vessel], at least not in itself, and if a human vessel is deaf one should not assume that they [the aforementioned hypothetical human vessel] is mentally ill or mentally disabled, by soldier class [law enforcement and-or military regardless of race/species] or by anyone else.

Idea #0176:
	Sky boys have natural white skin that is nonhuman and like arctic white snow and 'white' used here ['in this context' is I think how humans say it] does not refer to Cauasian skin that any humans ever have not even albinos of course.  This is the same information that there was to begin with when mentioning zarakites and is still the same information that there is now and this has not changed and I don't haven't had any different information over the last few years or so either.  This wasn't any different but has been exactly the same in North Olmsted and Cleveland Clinic and at Lake Pointe and was the same when I had my apartment in the building apartment 505 and outside my apartment and in the parking lot and in grocery stores and around town and at the college at Tri-C and other places too and is still the same.  Sky boys and zarakites never were supposed to be human and I've said that over and over again with the same information and so it isn't like they are 'white people' or 'black people' or Asians or any sort of humans at all.

Idea #0177:
	Zarakite tribes have their own human and-or Ancient lawyer and-or attorney [I don't know the difference between the two, I personally use the words 'lawyer' and 'attorney' interchangably, both casually and everything else] for their tribe ['tribe' is also referred to as a 'zarakite greater family' and both terms are used in professional language].  In the USA, their tribal lawyer is required to be with a USA human law firm and have credentials to practice law in the United States of America and have the chief of the tribe [a zarakite dragon sky boy with more than one head] and-or the entire tribe [All of the zarakite dragons in a tribe plus all of the half dragons of such etc] as clients [?].  This aforementioned lawyer must also be familiar with Zarakite Law as well and be authorized with the proper credentials to do professional stuff a lawyer and-or attorney does with that type of law as well in the USA at both state and federal levels and also sub-state levels etc [?].  This aforementioned lawyer and-or attorney has to maintain a professional relationship with the tribe and can't have what USA law would call a 'personal' relationship that lawyers and attorneys arn't supposed to have with their clients, however that works.  One should note that this Idea wasn't typed out or explained by any legal professional as any human set of laws would see it or consider it and in addition has been typed by someone who isn't qualified or authorized to give out any type of legal advice of any sort as any type of professional but only as some casual layman at best who can't explain what any law means with any legal weight to his words anywhere on Earth.

Idea #0178:
	Loose ideas:
	Dragon sky boys both zarakites and half zarakites learning to manage their humans and hybrids and ancients [?] and sky children in public schools where humans and ancients and hybrids and sky kids and dragon sky boys etc all go
	Dragon sky boys need to bathe and feed and provide milk and sex for their boys of various types
	Dragon sky boys need to change their boys' clothes at the start and end of phyical education classes in public schools and also take care of their sexual needs for their magic points
	Dragon sky boys need to manage their boys' detachables and body parts and heads and skins
	Dragon sky boys need to manage their boys' hygene and dress and style and at least some of their lifestyles
	Dragon sky boys need to be involved in stuff like this [aforementioned] for their boys' lives outside of public school as well plus their human families their boys come from
	Dragon sky boys need to be able to provide stuff like this aformentioned for their boys when they need and want a change of clothes and body artwork and go places with their families and by themselves and out to have fun [shopping malls and parks and beaches and wilderness areas and out to public town recreation centers and music lessons and skate parks and music concerts and picnics and vacations and theme parks and snowboarding and sports and ETC and that's just the tip of the iceberg]
	Dragon sky boys need to keep up with where their boys live and keep in touch with their parents and families as well and work out how and when they are going to be available for them and take care of them and the specifics for each family and establish agreements and arrangements with each of the individual families and manage to be more of a friend and not a 'parent' as much as practical with all of their boys
	Dragon sky boys need to figure out and work out who is to be called or summoned when one of their boys has an accident [anywhere] or needs some legal paperwork filled out to sign up for something or whatever as well as who can default to whom and in what order as their boys have their human families with their own parents [and their own backups if a parent is sick and some uncle or aunt so-and-so needs to be called on a telephone] to begin with and other practical common sense stuff.....
	Dragon sky boys also need to do these things with each other including their own lesser families and their tribe
	Dragon sky boys of every tribe also need to manage these things given that their half zarakites aka half dragons grow up faster and lose their juvenile markings body artwork faster than their zarakites which is normal.....
	Dragon sky boys need to be available in their boys public schools for classes and stuff their boys are involved in and signed up for
	Dragon sky boys learn how to do these things in their own classes and public schooling and such [?]
	Dragon sky boys for all of these things includes zarakites as well as half zarakites including juveniles of such and including zarakites with more than one head.  5,000-head dragons are a special case and are exempt.....
	Dragon sky boys who are zarakites with more than one head typically have more than one head simultaneously signed up for the same classes [?].
	Dragon sky boys and various sky boys use their wristwatches and tethering usually and not often telephones while with other aforementioned types this stuff varies [?].
	Ancients are special cases with their own situations.  Same thing with humans.

Idea #0179:
	I remember when Paul S Reeves was dungeon master, and he called himself a 'purist' because he stuck to the player's handbook and dungeon master's guide strictly and didn't accept any other ideas or such and was very uptight about such.  He was also a dungeon master who was a DM for plenty of adventures where there were undead enemies including many that could be 'turned' by spell-casting priests like the characters that Mike Warnick would frequently play.  Such priest characters in his fantasy role-playing campaigns could also peform exorcisms as well as turn the undead and such priests would also cast plenty of magic spells and such and would do so as humans.  Such priests had their magic spells also deal with possession and such and also involve demons and other wierd beings of various worlds and Aarakocra were also involved in Paul's campaigns and fantasy worlds.  In such fantasy worlds created by Paul Samuel Reeves Aarakocra were also at one point used as one or more player characters that were allies of aforementioned human priest characters played by Mike Warnick, and this was done because of Paul Samuel Reeves's ideas and deceptions back in the 1990s on planet Earth when he was Dungeon Master.  I know about these things and know they happened and are fact because I witnessed such in mundane ways with my eyes and ears just as any healthy ordinary human being would and it wasn't like I was psychic or any sort of mind reader or anything.  Mike Warnick was also a witness to such things in the exact same way.  Mike Warnick also loved to play such aforemnentioned priest characters that never would be allowed to exist in real life.  Zare of SkyCrown would never allow any such priests to exist in real life and would never want such things, or ask for such things, ever.  I don't think Earth would tolerate such priests either.  Also, no immortal from planet Earth ever wanted to become any such priest or any such Aarakocra.  No immortal from planet Earth ever asked to be any such priest or any such Aarakocra in any real life or any life ever.

Idea #0180:
	Not wanting to be evil is itself not an evil thing [at least in a simplistic sense within the same values] and this is in zarakite values [as well as other value systems which is presumed of course].

Idea #0181:
	I've noticed that when I get tough on corruption within the ranks of my own as well as allies, I get a lot of support and really accomplish a lot that doesn't get undone easily thanks to flushing out traitors and renegades who don't belong and are too damn evil for anyone to accept them including in any afterlife and this type of being tough on corruption and demanding executions that are permanant and don't leave anyone left to be reprogrammed or thought controlled or hypnotized or whatever by any failsafe really do make permanant and long-lasting gains that really do set back the dark hearted trio and dark hearted in permanant ways that never go away or have any setbacks, at least for now while I am still Proto.  One can say quite easily that these things certainlly have logic and practical common sense and are very believeable and have evidence that is difficult to deny, and have credibility that lasts and doesn't ever go away.  Such is honest at least in a general sense and difficult to deny over time.

Idea #0182:
	Zarakites aren't necessarily considered 'human' for outdated human laws and some cases are considered 'human' so to speak while in other cases they are considered wild animals etc and while considered 'zarakites' explicitly I'm not sure if such varies [?].
	[cloudy]

Idea #0183:
	As of yet 2019-09-09 CE Earth humans arn't used to the concepts of how zarakites and other sky boys are born for the first time in some cases and during the very first few minutes of life they talk and ask questions in complete sentences and run around having fun and have sex in a living room and figure out how any doors open and close and stuff and also have penile cravings plus cravings to go run around outside in green fields of grass and forests and hills among life of Earth origin in sunshine but also rain and in dry weather and wet mud and drizzle and horseplay and swordfight no matter the weather and no matter the season of the year or whatever applies and also swim across a lake or river or get ripped on by friends and family trying to [?] and make smarta-- remarks and wisecracks even within the first few minutes of life even if they find their family and parents pull a fast one or two by strategically giving birth to them right around the corner from something etc.  By comparison human beings are used to giving birth to a 'blob' of sorts that just lies mostly unmoving in a crib and can't go anywhere and in some cases can't turn it's head to the side on it's own and isn't exactly up for a balanced two-way conversation that's very intelligent [even 'me want milk' doesn't come right away and not even a year later maybe not that I actually know] and have to be around for a while and not living under a rock for a good number of years before they are capable of pulling an intelligent prank they can get away with at first before they have to stay after at grade school and then still don't usually make really good sarcastic jokes that involve anyting related to sex until they get to junior high and they do a bit more than dress themselves and get more interesting in different ways I guess.  Also juvenile sky boys can and will look and sound like sixteen year old human teenagers at times and shapeshift back and forth between the five ages which is normal and is also what schoolteachers and coaches etc and perhaps athletic rec centers [?] expect them to do at times including multiple times throughout the same schoolday and at the start and end of certain classes yet still be the same boy and same identity and not play too many games about it with the teachers and coaches etc [they get used to students that do these things and are trained and prepared for it far better than humans alone are capable of such even though meanwhile students pull jokes and pranks related to their detachables and how many of their faces look the same and inflated and deflated and degenerated and hidden and peices and parts of skins and heads and clothing and such passed around and other related pranks not to mention hiding classmates and their parts in backpacks and bags or whatever I have to get back to others about that stuff s--- I hate this why can't they find an adult zarakite dragon to do this I hate this this sucks].

Idea #0184:
	What's left of the CIA is sabotaging their own facilities where they have been running telepathic technologies after seeing they are too dangerous to exist I have heard.  I don't know if they are actually doing that or not as it's not like I ever worked for them.

Idea #0185:
	I've noticed that some Russian [post-USSR Eastern Euroupe] intelligence agency [one or more, I wouldn't know how many of course] has been very civilized and grown up about a lot of these matters, and have been helping me plan for zarakites and dragon sky boys and such to save planet Earth from hostile mind controllers and hostile evil humans, and have been doing this without pulling any childish nonsense that no president or senator would ever believe like claiming I'm supposedly ever some human spy for any spy agency or wanna-be psychic spy or ever asked to be any priest or religious clergy of any human religion, or ever asked to be any vampire or bat or cyborg or mentally ill person of any kind.  Other nations I've heard such as Norway have been doing pretty much the same thing and it isn't anything new.  As I see it I can easily imagine that aforementioned Russians and Norwegians and other nations as well including Croatia etc will and already do have a lot of credibility with this thing including before and during and after any Transition Period and for a long time afterwards with these types of understandings.  I'd think that there's plenty of other nations that would be the same way and probably already are.  It's a d--- shame that the USA is lagging so far behind.  That and as a side note I've heard that darn near every human nation OTHER than the USA has been using plenty of males and non-female humans and refusing to use too many downtown urban and Black-English-speaking types of staff and personell with their teams and failsafes and already decided to do such a very long time ago.  Using practical basic common sense and speaking as a very young 'juvenile zarakite' [I'm told to say] I'd think there IS a casual relationship between these two concepts.  [That's from Infocom's Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and not necessarily Douglas Adams which by comparison is all Paul S Reeves.]

Idea #0186:
	I think Paul S Reeves and his CIA who were long buddies of his escaped planet Earth from what I've heard.  Humans in the past have had a tendancy to leave me out of the rumor mill and lie to me thanks to all sorts of plastic weird stuff that made them evil and dangerous that I never heard of and was left out of for more than 30 (thirty) Earth years.

Idea #0187:
	I like and hate to eat the same stuff a TigerStone faced sky boy does at least when it comes to human food.  Such has already been honest for many years and decades using planet Earth years of course.

Idea #0188:
	Asperger's Syndrome is property of another universe and zarakites as well as the human species have no right to such.  The same with what I've been told is called 'schizoid' personalities which also doesn't belong on this planet [Earth] as well as the rest of this universe and really belongs to aforementioned other universe.  The same I think is truly honest regarding 'schizo-typical' belonging to the same as 'schizoid' although I'm not an expert and I'm a bit young and inexperienced with such things anyways and can't compete with humans from grade school socially [and never could] anyways.

Idea #0189:
	From a number of various conversations I'm being led to believe that I can be any of the five potential ages a zarakite can at any time [and I probably have to shape shift back and forth anywyas between the five ages for school and various classes and stuff] once I change to be a TigerStone and not ever go back [which isn't allowed] but that doesn't mean I won't be a juvenile or very young sky boy.  I've also gotten used to being called a 'baby' as its not like I shouldn't and I'm through with any delusions about being a human or being born another species like a human.  I've been quite past that for several years now at least.  I've also tried to explain this to exosolars a number of times and honestly every single time.

Idea #0190:
	This was going to come up anyways as I can't explain something I don't know and never learned, but I never got to know Billy Zegas.  I'm actually not even sure if we ever had any kind of conversation with each other, ever.  I don't think we ever did and I have no idea what his reputation was like in school.  I also never bothered to ask about him in school as its not like people would really tell me about anyone's reputation or any rumors or anything, which I put up with through all of junior high school and high school as well as grade school not to mention college.  I got used to that sort of treatment from humans and still feel bad about what they will have to go through [its not like its Billy's fault or anything, or Steve's or any of the others.  S--- I hate this self-introspective psychological talking-about-my-feelings horses--t but I know its not my fault or theirs and I didn't ask for this and neither did they].

Idea #0191:
	The half zarakite first name 'Jeopplandray' which is rather common for various sky boys and some humans as Zare offers such to humanity as a male gender name [?] is pronounced 'jepp-LAHN-dray' ['jep ln dra' with the second syllable accented] in Teenage Target Culture USA English.  Using American English, the first syllable rhymes with 'Depp' like the movie actor from Hollywood named 'Johnny Depp' as well as 'pep' as in 'pep rally', the second syllable rhymes with the 'lon' in 'pylon' and the 'lon' in 'longitude', and the third syllable rhymes with 'grey' which is a color that is also spelled 'gray'.  Zarakite American English almost always uses the nickname or short-name 'Jett' for 'Jeopplandray' quite frequently.  'Jett' is pronounced exactly the same in Zarakite American English as the Human American English 'jet' as in 'jet plane' and 'F-18 fighter jet' as well as the Human American English 'jet' as in 'jet black color'.

Idea #0192:
	In Zarakite tribes zarakites are careful to avoid accidentally naming any two or more of their half dragons the same first name although when it comes to middle names anything goes as they have so many and can run out of ideas and also don't like to be too limited when they think a name would be good with a face.  On the other hand they usually call them by their first name or nickname and most dragon sky boys don't bother using their middle names.  Most dragon sky boys don't really bother learning or remembering the middle name of most sky boys.  Some dragon sky boys have more than one middle name, and such a practice is not uncommon for both zarakites and half zarakites.  Dragon Sky boys don't tolerate having just a middle initial with no middle name, for practical reasons.

Idea #0193:
	Zarakite values don't see sky boys as evil, overall.

Idea #0194:
	Zarakite values don't see zarakites as evil.

Idea #0195:
	Zarakite values don't see half zarakites as evil.

Idea #0196:
	Zarakites don't see zarakites as evil.

Idea #0197:
	Zarakites don't see half zarakites as evil.

Idea #0198:
	Zarakites don't see sky boys as evil, overall.

Idea #0199:
	Zarakites don't see planet Earth as evil.

Idea #0200:
	Half Zarakites don't see planet Earth as evil.

Idea #0201:
	Sky boys don't see planet Earth as evil [or at least shouldn't if they know what's good for them, geez, and a few can be real stinkers that Zare and zarakite tribes don't take too kindly too, and as they see it could really get laid and get some good out of it, of course].

Idea #0202:
	Zarakites and half zarakites are well aware of what their penises do to all sky boys including each other within their own families in all directions regarding removing evil and evil tendancies, and are well aware that when they don't need it from each other their penises do it anyways just as strong but it won't hurt them or mess them up, and they enjoy the good stuff that comes with it anyways and the pleasure never gets old or becomes desensitized [at least not for more than a number of hours, less than a day's time], and such is of course common knowledge among all sky boys and all sky boys and hybrids know this stuff long before they start going to school, and this type of thing isn't forbidden conversation or taboo to come up in casual and professional talks as well as jokes and wisecracks anyways both with and without profanity.  Zarakite and half zarakite penises always enforce removal of the same evil values [evil according to both zarakite values and the religion SkyCrowne which of course have the same values and same opinions and judgements regarding what is good and what is evil etc] regardless of lesser family and regardless of tribe and regardless of what planet any dragon sky boy calls home of course.  This has nothing to do with the face or maturity of the zarakite or half zarakite.  As such, what all dragon sky boys enforce and cleanse regarding another's personality and spirit and any evils is always the same and in parallel, in absolute.  Using logic, no two dragon sky boys enforce good by removing evil in any way that conflicts.  Regarding the intensity and potency from each penis according to zarakite versus half zarakite as well as how many heads a zarakite has I'm not fully certain [?].  I guess this is subject to correction as usual but I really think this has consistency since the first time Zare (Zare of the zarakite and sky boy religion SkyCrown which is also typed interchangeably as 'SkyCrowne' which is presumed when I write and type the name 'Zare') thought up such ideas to begin with and all inclusive.

Idea #0203:
	For all human beings to be magical and psychic and telepathic and super-powerful as well as immortal is evil as motherf--- and any who make such evil according to zarakite values happen is doing evil beyond belief and this judgement is common sense and practical as well as logical according to zarakite values.

Idea #0204:
	For all of the human species to be magical and psychic and telepathic and super-powerful as well as immortal is evil beyond mind boggling comprehension and any who make such evil according to zarakite values happen is doing evil beyond belief and this judgement is common sense and practical as well as logical according to zarakite values.

Idea #0205:
	For the entire human species to be simultaneously and permanently magical and psychic and telepathic and super-powerful as well as immortal is evil according to combined zarakite values beyond understanding and any hint of responsibility and any who make such evil according to zarakite values occur is doing almighty unforgiveable and unacceptable evil beyond belief and this judgement is common sense and practical as well as logical according to combined zarakite values.

Idea #0206:
	I think I've been a bit overboard with, uh, 'colorful' ways of saying things, s---.....

Idea #0207:
	From a historical species point of view, all sky boys very skinny, perhaps unbelieveably so ['you've got to see it to believe it'].

Idea #0208:
	As part of sky boy clothing sky boys can grow a hat that is like a baseball cap.  They can grow it either facing straight forwards or facing straight backwards and not to any side.  When the grow it facing backwards, it isn't pointed straight backwards horizontally but is instead angled down as well as backwards.

Idea #0209:
	Robert Woodruff was never one of the chosen.  He also frequently goes by the name 'Bob' and attached a lot of dark hearted 'federal magic' and psychic thought control dark hearted evil to uttering his name telepathically.  I suspect he may have attached a lot of true esoteric actual dark hearted hostile mind control to it as well.  I was just told that he really tried to and this is no joke.

Idea #0210:
	The dark hearted are extremely dangerous when accused of anything or at least were.  They commit extreme unforgivable evils irregardless and use esoteric multi-worldly psychic rules to when anyone accuses them of anything including things that are extremely evil that they are obviously guilty of.  They have established such booby-trap-style esoteric rules so that they become far more dangerous and more empowered and capable of more evil and killing more innocents and doing more things that are universally evil irregardless of one world's value system to the next in more than one universe found inside and outside this collection of galactic filaments that forms this universe.  They also become increasingly more powerful just by being suspected of any sort of evil in ways that make them far more effective at scapegoating and blaming others for their evil actions and behaviors and discrediting innocents that suspect and accuse them and making such accusers look stupid as well as irrational and delusional.  They trick and decieve and fool such accusers into looking more than silly and blame such accusers of things they are guilty of doing and attempting to do.  This is consistent and they have been doing an excessive and extreme amount of these things within the last several years especially and have no shame.  Aforementioned dark hearted also make outrageous cheap shots to continue to involve themselves in things they should not be involved in and have no right to involve themselves in.  The whole time with all of their techniques they have massive efforts and think tanks and logistics to falsely make themselves appear to be innocent with one deception and strategy after another.  They also have greed that has no end and no shame beyond belief.  They also have this greed for what is not theirs to begin with and what they have no right to have, and have no ethics and no shame and no decency in doing so.

Idea #0211:
	Ideas #0179 through #0210 are honest.  'nuffs said.

Idea #0212:
	Ideas #0000 through #0210 I think are honest, combined.  Yes, I also change my mind sometimes, and I would of course be lying and be dishonest if I claimed I never did.  'nuffs said.

Idea #0213:
	The vast majority of all of the Originals if not all of them including the ones I had to let go I really don't know anything about any more than Billy Zegas of course.  'nuffs said.

Idea #0214:
	I have seen that many humans are very dangerous and easily become extremely evil and hostile when they get older and such has gotten progressivelty worse including the last several years especially to the point where no one can tolerate them and no one is willing to accept them in any afterlife and many have concerns about them dying because they are worried about what afterlife they will end up in as well as where they might reincarnate and aforementioned humans are too dangerous to any afterlife and to dangerous to any world to be reincarnated in.  'nuffs said.

Idea #0215:
	Ideas #0213 and #0214 as well as Idea #0212 are all true and are also all honest just as much as each other as I see it and believe it and have no reason to believe otherwise.  'nuffs said.  I think this Idea is also honest and have no practical reason to believe otherwise.  I also have no logical reason to believe that this whole Idea as literally typed start-to-finish is illogical.

Idea #0216:
	After all that has transpired, I am told that right now I have innocence.  I am also told that I'm not evil.  I'm also told that I never was evil.  I was just told these things by what I think are three different source.  I not going to say that these things are true.  I'm also not going to say that these things are honest.  It's not like I would actually know of course and most humans including the ones in charge of telepathic teams and agencies especially are well aware of that irregardless of when-if they pretend otherwise.

Idea #0217:
	I [Proto and whatever I was born as since 1978 CE planet Earth] never planned on leaving planet Earth and jumping into another - reality, dimension, existance, multiverse, time [as in time travel] - and never asked for such a thing.  Also I never time traveled as a human would call it [In Zarakite American English the phrase means the same thing and is of course spoken as well as typed and otherwise communicated in the exact same ways].

Idea #0218:
	Ordinary healthy human beings who never became psychic or telepathic and lived right before the end of the twentieth century Common Era planet Earth [the same planet Earth I was born on which is presumed as it always should be by default of course] in a hypothetical scenario have the ability to - read, write, speak, think, imagine - Zarakite American English with the same amount of difficulty as Human American English.  In addition aforementioned humans in the same hypothetical imaginary scenario that learn Zarakite American English would - read, write, speak, think, imagine - Human American English in the same exact ways as long as they tried to learn Zarakite American English the same way they would learn any common human language from their own world of course.

Idea #0219:
	Humans at this point should definitely never be psychic or have any esoteric non-mundane powers [like you wouldn't believe] [don't ask, looooong story].

Idea #0220:
	I'm not used to having to safe-guard my own thoughts were I have to be careful not to think certain words or imagine specific ideas.  I wasn't born in any such way and never asked for ending up having to deal with such an outrageous evil hardship and punishment I didn't ever deserve and never would have wanted or asked for.  Also there is no way any - I, Zare of any SkyCrown, any zarakite values, Proto, Destructavator, David A Reeves born September 25 1978 Common Era planet Earth social security number 287-74-8719 born in HELL called Cleveland in some hospital I never memorized - that have any business having anything to do with such things in that ordered list in this sentence would ever tolerate or want or ask for any aforementioned paranoid harsh hardship-laden lifestyle of having to self-control and discipline one's thoughts as ANY sky boy because with the understanding that anything else is too unforgiveably unforgettably undeniably irrefutably EVIL according to zarakite values of at least THIS universe that I was born in.

Idea #0221:
	I have not died since September 25 1978.

Idea #0222:
	I have not reincarnated since at least September 25 1978 if not at all.

Idea #0223:
	I [my spirit as I call it and sense of self as well as conciousness] have not left my physical body since at least September 25 1978 if at all.

Idea #0224:
	I never asked for or wanted any mentally ill person to be a god or divine being or spirit guide of any kind for me.  This includes any deceased person and this also includes any person who used to be a human at any point then became another species.  I never would have wanted such a thing.  I never would have asked for such a thing.

Idea #0225:
	I never asked for or wanted any human [human official, human civilian, any human, any lifestyle, all inclusive] to be a god or divine being or spirit guide of any kind for me.  This includes any deceased person and this also includes any person who used to be a human at any point then became another species.  I never would have wanted such a thing.  I never would have asked for such a thing. 

Idea #0226:
	Ideas #0211 through #0226 combined are honest.

Idea #0227:
	From what I recall Arabs have explained that there is no 'game show' at all for immortality.  This means that there was never any real compitition for any prize where anyone could compete to be an immortal.  I was told by more than one source that the Arabs had the honest and correct information regarding this.  I was also told by the Arabs that if they did hypothetically have the ability or power to make some human immortal and I was some human then they obviously wouldn't have chosen me of course.  I was told that they saw I had what appeared at a glance to be a hard life that was unfair but that doesn't mean that they would make me immortal [yikes].  Humans often die of unfair hardships all the time and never get justice in many such cases.  Also life is unfair which is normal in this universe.  The Arabs knew that and many still do now and they wouldn't have had any power in their hands to begin with much less have the equivilant of enough to be worthy of enrolling in any public junior high school I ever went to if they didn't have such basic practical common sense to begin with.  In the same way there was never any 'Highlander' [the USA Hollywood movie] style competition that one or more human psychics and-or human vessels were all ape-s--- about.  I have no reason to believe that at any point the Arabs were full of it regarding any of this stuff.  I was also told that there was pretty much the same information from a being who isn't from planet Earth.  Maybe this also helps or maybe it doesn't but I learned a long time ago in sixth grade junior high school in Mrs Cornell's history or social studies class [I can't remember which it was] that 'Arab' and 'Muslim' are not necessarily the same thing [some Arabs are another religion and some Islamic people are not Arabs].  This was the same class where I learned from the teacher and being educated by her lectures that some Arabs wear a checkered red and white headress which despite what it looks like would not make a good cloth to put on an outdoor table for a picnic but is actually a very sacred headress worn by Islamic leaders and using it for a picnic tablecloth would be very insulting and offensive in ways that should not leave one bemused.  This was the exact same class where I learned what the term 'infidel' really means and that it simply means 'one who is not of one's own religion' nothing more and nothing less and can be spoken by someone of any religion to someone else of any other religion and actually isn't necessarily something that has to be insulting or derogatory when you think about it.  Also, it's not reserved just for Muslims to use in a sentence when referring to someone.  That and her class also taught me that while the Muslims had old laws in their holy book about a concept of 'peace' that meant killing everyone else so that you are the only person left alive [not what I would call peace, I'd call it evil, yikes] was an archaic and badly outdated concept that almost all modern-day Muslims let go of and no longer have in their religion [some 99 (ninety-nine) percent of them, and that was back then, whenever that study or whatever was that she used for the class].

Idea #0228:
	Ideas #0000 through #0227 when combined are honest.  'nuff said.

Idea #0229:
	I mess up and make mistakes all the time.  I also never claimed to be perfect.  I don't remember any human ever thinking I was perfect and if I thought correctly that would have been a good thing.  I'm also used to doing things without certainty and without knowing.  That and I'm used to being corrected and I'm used to these things as normal everyday life.  I've never been used to any other type of life or lifestyle.  Also, I'm okay with not knowing [as in not bothering to know, duh] the answer to everything.  [I can do fine without ever memorizing a dictionary, thank you very much.  I think I'll have a life instead.  That and I used to tell people that I could die happily with a smile on my face without knowing the answers to stuff like that.  Coincidentally I hate bugging people like that who have better things to do with their time anyways, not to mention that would make me an evil brat and a pest that I and everyone else would hate.]  'nuff said.

Idea #0230:
	I have a problem trusting others becuase I've been lied to and betrayed as well as set up and 'stabbed in the back' too many times and for far too long [decades actually and not just years].  The dark hearted and the dark trio both come to mind and that's just the tip of the iceberg that doesn't even start to end with what can be found on this planet.  Not even close.

Idea #0231:
	If even one of the personalities of one face from The Book Of Faces doesn't come out right, that messes up a whole one out of every one hundred of the entire population and species of all sky boys and hybrids and humans and ancients and expendables etc as well as the 5,000 headed dragon Zare himself and all of his legendary immortal heads and such.

Idea #0232:
	I sent an email today about half an hour past noon, and it was very unpleasant for me to type and send.  It was very evil, as well as unpleasant for myself, that I was forced to do such.

Idea #0233:
	There have been Negro operators and telepaths that have been involved that really want a 'Black god' or Negro immortal of sorts, in many of their plans with tear-off skin, which they want to have with Caucasian or white skin of some sort underneath, so that they can bully and victimize such an immortal, including rape with putting their penis or any penis and probably other stuff as well up the rectum of such immortal, that won't die but will suffer and experience pain, so that of course they can bully and victimize the same over and over again as many times as they want, and take turns doing so, and get their own pleasure that they love and cherish as frequently as they want, which is just evil. 'nuffs said.  This does not make me racist of course.  This simultaneously makes them racist of course.  This simultaneously also makes them very evil beyond belief of course.  At the same time this also leaves me innocent of course.  I can't imagine these things as being irrefutable in this entire universe, and every galaxy within such.  This also is all just practical and logical common sense according to zarakite values.  All of these sentences in this whole paragraph just make sense.  'nuffs said.  They also love it when this information has to be exposed, as it gives them opportunities to try to accuse me of being racist, and they also try to build support with each other, to gang up on me, and bully and victimize me while pretending to be innocent.  'nuffs said.

Idea #0234:
	Exosolars need to be on planet Earth, and simultaneously be taken seriously about what world they are from, and have their authority and how evil beings on Earth have to yield to aforementioned authority also taken very seriously.

Idea #0235:
	Too many goverment lawmakers of all nations on planet Earth have already decided more than a few years ago that they are never going to accept me and would have to be forced one-hundred-percent into doing so by being mind controlled or thought controlled into doing so and still want traps left behind as well, as me looking evil no matter what because of mass deceptions on their part.  Too many religious leaders of various religions across planet Earth already did the exact same thing as the aforementioned lawmakers I just mentioned.  Both groups keep bullying and forcing me into retyping and rewriting these things repeatedly over the last year or two, and their efforts have been working and successful for their casuses which are all evil.  'Evil' in this case is evil according to my values, and irrefutable as such.  'Evil' in this case is also evil according to zarakite values, and irrefutable as such, and many know it and remember it and take it seriously in more than one literal universe.  Other groups are involved as well, and are just like the first two I mentioned, and are also very powerful, and self-empowered themselves with far too much esoteric psychic and magical powers that are real and are not 'federal magic' or any technology that fakes any religion or involves spirit guides etc from what I've been told [they don't do that for any human being].  That and what's up with the nursing staff mysteriously seeming to always know how much water I have left in any cup with a lid on it that is in my bedroom, any furniture?  It's not like they ever look and check or have to, unless authority gets involved to supervise, and they playact and play games to create false pretense and reasons to look in a cup I have no matter how silly.  They only do that just sometimes, and for a short while.  Other times they don't bother, as if they have a way of turning any supervision to their side.  They seem to be well practiced, and well experienced in such things.  Their skills and capabilities seem to only be getting better.  Their numbers are shrinking as they are enemy hostiles and enemy combatants being defeated somehow, but whatever among their forces that remain have been apparently increasing and furthering their skills, as well as how dangerous and empowered with non-passive powers they are.  They have been seeking, almost invariably it seems, to empower themselves with superpowers that work on targets nowhere within where they can see or hear.  As such, they don't have to even know where their target is.  They also don't have to be anywhere near their target, and could be anywhere and on any planet and in any universe.  These are the types of powers that all three of the groups I've mentioned have been trying to self-empower themselves with, and these powers described are the powers they want and have been fighting to aquire more than anything any chance they get and without shame or care of being fired or arrested or executed.  These are the goals they have had and still do.  Irregardless of their successes and failures and how beings from outside of this planet that support both zarakite values and SkyCrown have been defeating these groups of people on this planet, these are the 'dark hearted' and the dark hearted are evil in the eyes of all beings of all worlds when any such beings know enough honest information about the dark hearted and understand what information about the dark hearted is honest and what information about the dark hearted isn't honest.  Note that this was unhappily written in language that is long and wordy and messed up, because of Haldeman's computer.

Idea #0236:
	I don't have any skills to be a top secret agent or spy of any sort, and never did.  I never had any skills to be anything close to an undercover police officer, either.

Idea #0237:
	I want all of the evil aforementioned in Idea #0235 to invariably lose, and lose forever.  I also want all of the evil aforementioned in Idea #0235 to fail as much as practical at defeating all beings who - fight aforementioned evil in Idea #0235 so that it is done permanantly and aforementioned evil in Idea #0235 overall doesn't come back, accept me as being in charge of this universe or at least this planet Earth [depends on how much is needed, but, yikes, I think someone has to, enough is enough], accept all of my combined and self-corrected multipassed and other weird stuff that I wouldn't know how to describe zarakite values [which includes wants and desires and stuff with salt and other food as I call it], or at least make me able to do all the stuff in the previous concept in this ordered list myself which I would glady do with myself and my zarakite tribes and all sky boys as I call them [I don't accept any human beings as so-called 'zarakites' and say that they are not zarakites and they are just human beings being evil a-hole brutes, though stage set actors or hands or whatever that are NOT evil at ANY time are of course exceptions], have their worlds and lifestyles intact as much as aforementioned zarakite values would allow [each world is a seperate case and needs individual treatment, to be compliant with zarakite values and not be evil instead of course], not have any further evil [according to aforementioned zarakite values] from aforementioned evil sources influence [in all sorts of weird-a-- esoteric ways] any worlds [and their life-forms, sorry to sound callous, my head is dizzy far beyond what would kill any mortal being on this planet I think] involved any more than already [already have and already probably will, although I don't want to be picky about thinking out logicstics too far for this one]
[incomplete]

Idea #0238:
	'Blacks' as African Americans call them do not get to witness how they are saved from any mind controller invasion.  This includes both genders.  They have to trust.

Idea #0239:
	[Note that if you want to get to the point, you want the third paragraph] Mister Chris Sandusky was one of the humans [someone who appeared to me to be an ordinary non-esoteric civlilian common everyday human, which is presumed] who played Dungeons And Dragons pen-and-paper with myself and Mister Adam Hill and Mister Mike Warnick and Jim Gedra (Mister James Gedra Jr, who I've normally remembered over the years as 'Jim Gedra' or 'Jimmy Gedra', and when I first met him it was quickly established after seeing him once or twice or something as 'Jimmy' and then later I would think of him and talk about him with people when he wasn't present as 'Jim Gedra' becuase when he got a bit older and then started shaving a blond mustache and getting his driver's license 'Jimmy' didn't feel to me like a name I should call him and 'Jim' I thought felt better to refer to him as.  And as a side note I hate to talk like that, like a messed-up dork, yikes.), as well as Mister Eric Anderson and Mister Ryan Tracy for at least a while and a guy with black hair and sometimes a beard who would sometimes wear a hankerchief on his head covering his scalp who went by the name Brian, not to mention another Mister 'Brian' who the rest of the 'gang' as some lady wants me to call all of us would call 'that fat kid' when he wasn't around, who is not the same 'Brian' as a bunch of other guys in my life who had and sometimes still have the name 'Brian' which is a name that in itself is not inherently evil according to zarakite values, and 'Brian' is indeed a name that is used in Zarakite tribes for half dragons from time to time and is spoken and pronounced in the same ways a healthy normal human that is not at all a vessel would.
	Mister Chris Sandusky was rather socially aggresive in conversation every time the concept of decapitation of a character became the topic of discussion in pen and paper role playing games including both Dungeons And Dragons as well as Shadowrun etc.  This happened a number of times spanning multiple years and in more than one household and various locations where gameplay took place [which also included more than one 'Reality Recess' in both Great Northern Shopping Center as well as it's other location on Brookpark Extension road in the City Of North Olmsted near but not inside of the shopping mall area and closer to Guitar Center and what used to be First Run Video.  Note that Brookpark Extension is not the same as Brookpark Road which runs outside of North Olmsted and goes through towns such as Fairview Park and Parma and other towns. Brookpark road is not directly connected to Brookpark Extension and Brookpark Extension is exclusively in the City Of North Olmsted only and is actually very short.  As such Brookpark extension does not go outside the city limits of the Town Of North Olmsted.  Note that this information regarding both Brookpark road as well as Brookpark extension is common knowledge among people that live in Cuyahoga County at least, and such is also public information that is not at all confidential or classified or top secret or whatever, and therefore talking about this information as well as asking for directions to such places at a gas station in North Olmsted is NOT going to make any local person or police officer flip out and make the inquiry into something that involves a police report of any kind whatsoever and in addition probably wouldn't even make a human police officer's duty log who works in North Olmsted depending on the circumstances.].
	Anyways, whenever the concept of any charcter's [NPC as well as player character] head would be cut off for any reason in gameplay [role-playing and not MD of course] and there was talk about a humanoid character's body still being alive and picking up it's [his or her or it's or what have you] living head from any soil or floor [carpet or whatever silly extrapolation knock yourself out] and reattaching it to their neck and having it part of their body again, as well as once again being one being with one personality and conciousness and self-awareness of some sort and not two [or more...], Mister Sandusky would get pushy and loud-mouthed to make sure that in every such conversation 'But what if you're body rebels, and doesn't want your head back!?' and such a character's body giving a middle finger of all variety of sorts [being defiant about the idea of reattaching it's head for a wide variety of reasons that varies tremendously in so many potential hypotheticals under the sun] to it's head.  Mister Chris Sandusky was always really big on this 'rebellion against your head' idea, and was a long-time proponent and darn near zealot spanning years and one conversation after another, I think consistent, and really wanted it accepted by everyone in every get-together playing any role playing game, and consistently really wanted it to be the real thing.

Idea #0240:
	Teenage Target Culture is a culture of humans that are not vessels.  This was assumed by myself for understandable and logical as well as practical reasons to have already been established with no need to explain such additional information.  One can also say in both Human American English as well as Zarakite American English that such is 'a safe assumption'.

Idea #0241:
	If a sky boy detaches his head, and then appears to not want it back on, the boy's skin is playacting and perhaps goofing off, and this can happen when he is with other boys, and they are getting rowdy or whatever.  This playacting is superficial of course, and probably short-lived, before it becomes a dumb joke that gets old and is no longer funny if it were to go for too long of course.  This type of thing for dragon sky boys is public common knowledge and isn't restricted as zarakites tribes see it.  Such aforementioned knowledge is well-known at some point sooner or later among the stars and various civilizations from different worlds in more than one galaxy, including among civilizations that don't have any psychics or telepaths.  According to Zare's goals that he wants and desires accomplished zarakites and all of their sky boys are to have a reputation for such things.  Using practical common sense that Zare of SkyCrowne wants all sky boys to have as well as easy quick logic that Zare also wants all sky boys to have all sky boys according to Zare's aforementioned goals and such would have many other things included as reputations for all sky boys which sky boys are used to and don't see as evil that the information as described in this paragraph contain are dependent upon including but not limited to - personalities of sky boys, what sky boys look like, what sky boys sound like, what sky boys smell like, what sky boys like to do for fun, what sky boys do and don't believe in, what sky boys hate, what sky boys' bodies and anatomies are like, what sky boys find good and evil, what sky boys probably would and wouldn't do in various hypothetical situations, how smart and how dumb sky boys are in various ways, how to approach sky boys as an outsider to Earth-origin life to avoid misunderstandings and the right way to talk to a sky boy and the wrong way to approach a sky boy all in various ways, sky boy humor, sky boy playfulness, sky boy pranks and common tactics including frequent and casual reincarnation [interpretations vary of course] of dragon sky boys, The Zarakite Sex Drive, sky boy lifestyles that include milking and sex and other penile stuff [?] - all within reasonable and practical limitations that require multi-universal and multi-multiversal agreement.

Idea #0242:
	I know of one way of correcting a mistake.  I know of heading out and driving a car to go see someone and driving with malice and emotion.  Driving with a thirst for vengeance with a sword ready and being prepared to deal death.  That type of 'correcting a mistake'.
	'If he's guilty just shoot him.'  It doesn't actually work too well.  They've tried that.  'They' is of many worlds I'm sure.
	I was not prepared for a mistake of another sort I did not imagine and did not forsee.  I have been too stupid and misled.  Too obvious and too redundant as well.  Wetting a table is bad and now I see if I search for something symbolic I bring about a tsunami and all the ache of heart and head that comes with it and lingers long after.  Loss.  Confusion.  Inspiration.  This dragon's heart and spirit is touched and I was not expecting such.  There is almight pain there and it concerns me.  I now have learned something when shame is there and is taken away and is but is not.  The same with a mistake the size of myself.  Stuck between worlds so to speak I'm not sure where I'm going or from what sky I'll fall from first.  I don't even know where this is going and I'm trying to keep it solid and secure despite the assumptions that the humans will make I'm sure.  I can't imagine yet what this shall be with five heads and not one outside of jest and not bemused.  I hope and wish at least some of that is clear enough.  Wow.  This jester doesn't want to be silly anymore.  At least not as much.
	I feel bad for what I am sorry I am going to call a cat and his kind.  I know he is not a fool and I know that behind the words that reach me there is what knows how to say things like this better than I can.
	This is very heartbreaking for more than one family and I can see this happening again more than enough times for one world.
	I am bad at speeches and for this one I really tried.  I can see I would be very bad just the same at funerals though I'm not sure if I should practice or accept futility.

Idea #0243:
	The term 'ninja' needs to go back to whom it belongs to in all Zarakite American English meanings.  For other zarakite languages the same applies and I think 'of course' does as well.  This is a quest of some sort if it has to be and this is one that I feel is unresolved.  As such I want to solve this quest along the way to Zare's other wants and desires.  I don't think the word 'ninja' and related uses of such in my writings and files is where it should be and I need to go with someone's opinion as everyone's opinion is biased anyways.  This is so simplistic and I am so stupid but I don't think but I know I want a biased opinion that is biased to be Japanese and unpolluted and untainted as much as possible as such.  I am just going to go ahead and be stupid anyways and say that seeking an unbiased opinion is an act of futility.  I'm stubborn and I'll glady go out and be not just arrogant but stupid as well if that's what I have to do and not dwell on it.  If it gets the job done then it gets the job done and it just works.  I hate this as I'd rather not type an essay about it and we know the rest.  I see I've been rude and insulting as well.  Well, I do that.  I guess leaving out being extraneous is coming.  Time to get to it is how I see it including doing my part.

Idea #0244:
	Cloud Strife's voice actor Steve Burton might not be what is accurate regarding what a TigerStone sounds like.  I'm still trying to figure out as Tiger has four children who are like Cloud Strife and one is even named Cloud and many sky boys sound the same and not just on a telephone and such.

Idea #0245:
	Sky boys and dragon sky boys especially are never used to or well adjusted to any sort of telepathic lifestyle except maybe elves who are used to such as needed but the rest of the time the same as any common sky boy with abs [?].

Idea #0246:
	All sky boys like pleasure which includes - listening to music of various sorts, eating food of various sorts, satisfying cravings of the Zarakite Sex Drive, getting good grades in public school from Teenage Target Culture and-or something comparable, sometimes playing video games of certain types and-or something comparable, sometimes going to heavy metal concerts and-or something comparable, sometimes going to rock concerts and-or something comparable, sometimes going to heavy metal concerts and-or something comparable, sometimes going to see and hear live music and-or something comparable, sometimes music videos and-or something comparable, sometimes going to see a movie and-or something comparable, sometimes going to a public shopping mall and-or something comparable, sometimes enrolling in and participating in after-school sports and-or something comparable, sort of going swimming in swimming pools and-or something comparable but not diving [humans do all this stuff differently] [?], going swimming in natural bodies of water and-or something comparable [humans REALLY do this VERY differently but skinny-dipping might be sort of close and I'm really guessing on this one] [?], doing all of these things presumably as a common ordinary mundane non-religious non-telepathic healthy teenage human boy from Teenage Target Culture, all these things [in this ordered list] presumably being as they are found in Teenage Target Culture - although this is somewhat inaccurate as humans don't do these things the same way as sky boys and Teenage Target Culture doesn't include any sentient beings other than humans in it or any non-Earth-origin life forms either [Teenage Target Culture needless to say is theoretical and doesn't account for even all of planet Earth let alone the rest of planet Earth's universe etc of course.  Such is also ignorant and unknowing reagarding how little the theoretical human people from Teenage Target Culture think they know and how normal this is for their folk.  Such theoretical human people having never met or heard of any sky boys or magic anything like zarakite magic is also characteristic of Teenage Target Culture.  Teenage Target Culture DOES by the way include two genders of aforementioned theoretical humans that are male and female as well as the schoolteachers and people around town however the male gender teenage boy from such who is in school and is common and ordinary and healthy and his point-of-view of life are both presumed for hypotheticals as well as lack of criminal nature meaning such presumed point-of-view is a human who never got and never gets arrested by law enforcement of the same hypothetical species.].

Idea #0247:
	I was told not to talk about everything but there's more stuff I'd like to get back to regarding sky boys of at least one or two clans and related stuff.  This involves typing stuff on my computer as well as uploading stuff from my computer to places on the Internet as well as playing video games on my computer as well as watching music videos on my computer as well as handwriting stuff as well as jacking off that includes ejaculating and cleaning it up later as well as eating food that includes salt and more than one source of caffiene in various and large amounts all as part of getting stuff done regarding aforementioned sky boys and stuff related to sky boys.  I was also told to mention how I'm still not potty trained and probably can't be with the form factor I have now which I shouldn't have anyways and I think this has to do with how long it takes for my kind to grow up and it takes too long for that to happen with a human-ish-like body and-or physical body that resembles a human body which I should really never shape-shift into looking at how my body is now at least.  I was also told that I should have my pleasure and things I like as much as practical even given my circumstances and not be tricked out of it.  I was told I should not be bullied.  I was told I should not be manipulated.  I was told I should not lose my stuff.  I was told I need friends I can actually trust.  I was told I was not evil.
	I have also been told I should not be gullible and it is too dangerous for too many for me to be so gullible like how I am now [which is involuntary and not something I like or enjoy at all].

Idea #0248:
	TigerStone faced sky boys and actually all sky boys should not be gullible or easily misled.  This also applies to the sky children for the most part.  As for the dragon sky boys they should be less gullible even more so than all other clans if they are to conform to what both Zare of SkyCrown as well as Zare of the past and real life right now want to happen.  For sky boys to also be how aforementioned Zare[s] want to happen dragon sky boys cannot generally be annoying when it comes to everyday small talk casual conversation and socializing as such would be applicable in Teenage Target Culture as a hypothetical human teenager from Teenage Target Culture.

Idea #0249:
	All sky boys within their clan and type and such have natural trade-offs [ups and downs] with advantages and disadvantages [I hate being wordy] according to what face they have from the Book Of Faces so if one sky boy compared to another sky boy of the same type has a different face then one might tend to be a really good swordfighter while another might tend to be really popular with penile stuff in certain ways while another has a tendency to be really brave yet obedient hunting in a group and with family etc etc etc etc etc as 'this Zare' has really wanted and sought for quite some time now out of a bunch of stuff with his values.....
