scratchpad which is not the same as so-and-so's scratchpad, who's scratchpad is not the same as this scratchpad
[Sorry I have to write like a dork through this interface.  Some of this is extraneous and brain-melting, but at least it's not in a non-Earth-in-Origin language, which would suck.  I still feel sorry for others I have to drag through this, and this stuff is unbelieveable, but at least a handful get to have blue and blond hair on the SAME head and not worry too much about having more than one of yourself hanging out with you and talking to you with his own ideas while actually being you at the same time and sharing a wee little bit more than your wardrobe as far as the personal stuff goes.  Okay, just wait until we get to expendables.....]
[Also, last time I checked, no one will have a biker jacket for one of the five clothing upperwear styles or accessories, or ten or whatever, and YES, it was just fine with me if the old one was sold to Goodwill or thrown out in the garbage, I forgave him for that a long time ago and never vilified or accused him of anything related to that to begin with, and even let him have the garbage bag I offered it to him in, right into the trunk of his car, geez.....]

Idea #1659:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   10:28  EST :  One cannot regain/recover/reclaim/get-back/restore what they never had-to-begin-with/had-initially/once-had/had-at-first/had.  'Nuffs said.  This altogether still both makes sense and simply makes sense.

Idea #1660:
     2020-04-30    Common-Era   10:31  EST :  At least two out of three of the dark hearted trio like the idea of being psychic, and are into that sort of thing.  They also love mind games and deceptions and manipulating others.  It fits with dark hearted trio values, it fits with their values and ideals.  They would love to go around having an ability like a 'Jedi Mind Trick' that they could use on others all the time.  Such things are among what they would do if they could have superpowers over others.  Such things are really their kind of thing and among their likes and ideals.  Such things and such deceptions and manipulations are all against zarakite values, and evil according to zarakite values, and powers that zarakites would never have.  'Nuffs said.  This still simply makes sense.

	Type about how evil a guy I might or might not be, and what I did and didn't do to Steve S and Jimmy G and T Belka, etc, also Chris MacDonnel and Eric S and Joe A and others, also didn't want to blind-side anyone with destiny and thought 'chosen' have a right to know rather than a nasty unpleasant surprise and thought I'd be doing the right thing [while muddled with medications I shouldn't be on], also compare myself to the queen and what she did to Diane Minnery's and Ruth Fielder's families and how scheming and manipulative she is and I would never do such things, the dark queen seems to accuse me of being what she is as far as scheming and manipulative but I don't have specific examples, also guides and spirits I pray and meditate and work with say I'm not a pediphile and I'm not homosexual and I'm not evil and I'm not dangerous, and for a long time at least some of them knew how dangerous and evil the dark queen is but some were misinformed etc and thought I was like the dark trio and supposedly evil like them, but I'm the black sheep of the family and refuse to be like them, holding out on refusing to be evil, and I don't mind paper trails and telling the good and bad including self-incriminating stuff along with good information to a judge in a courtroom and simply being HONEST the whole time and honest the same to health insurance if given a chance, and I like paper trails and records to accumulate as long as they are honest and think that's a good thing while the dark trio are secretive and tight-lipped and hate paper trails and want others to always take their word for it and love it when no one questions their word and they are very sneaky and so far they've gotten away with it and have a lot to hide, also the one mental health professional who understood even half of these things was alarmed and saw a case for abuse and said strongly that I need a lawyer and am up against a lot, and he unfortunately lied to TriCare health insurance and billed the emergency counseling sessions a generic way so that 'counseling' would supposedly not necessarily be what appointments were for, and that's old Doc Chapman, and I had printouts from those appointments and TriCare in my old apartment in my fireproof safe and never photographed them but if I knew I would be hauled away to a hospital before being evicted and have no access to my apartment by surprise I would have copied them electronically, TriCare for life which is what I had can get old records if requested and some of the EOBs DO say 'counseling' or something similiar, billed by Doctor Chapman, and he didn't do the usual of billing Medicare then Tricare then Ohio Medicaid in that order which is what most doctors did for many years like clockwork but instead sent it to TriCare which took it from him like that, also I prefer to 'tell all' to health insurance and authority, and actually belive literally, STILL, in 'Father I cannot tell a lie, I chopped down the tree' as the right thing and the proper thing and a GOOD thing when it comes to values, instead of criminal 'lie, cheat, and steal' secretive and scheming behaivor like what all three of the dark trio do, and the dark king also keeps his own doctor appointments and health care out of Tricare so that Tricare doesn't know about it, and he claims that he has some independant 'contract' or special independant off-shoot organization that supposedly handles all of his healthcare which is supposedly why he doesn't use TriCare for anything according to what he says, although TriCare has him in the system but not sharing information, and both the king and queen have lied about stuff like this in the past many times, typically
Also, what kind of a monster was I not, during the 12 and a half years living at that apartment in North Olmsted, to the families and their children there?  The swimming pool, during summer months, where adults would sit and talk and sometimes talk to the children, and I didn't join them and didn't do anything to them in the building?  How about the college?  I had to pass an extensive background check to work for the police there, and maintain being clean as well as someone who never messed up the first time to begin with, to work there.  They trusted me to do foot patrol including the locker rooms, both male and female locker rooms, and one of the EMTs trusted me to help him go into both types of bathrooms to help people having medical emergencies while they were using the toilet.  Those were and still are police officers and professionals.  How about how I helped out Steven Schlaf right when I first met him and was his friend and pal in two different classes and between classes?  And also after those classes were over?  Gosh look at how I helped him out and he did better because of what I did and had to offer, and how evil a diabolical madman I must be that allegedly turns people's lives to s*** by being involved with them I must be...  Gosh what a monster I am, and now maybe telepathic operators can see these things.  How about how at the apartment building I could have gone swimming at the same time as the children who lived there?  In the same swimming pool?  How about how I could have been a monster there and had plenty of opportunities if I was that kind of sicko or something?  How about how I was Tim Belka's friend and had opportunities to be a sick monster with him and didn't?  And he was gullible and vulnerable with the way he was?  How about how careful I was with him and was his friend and helped him out more than once as well?  Like when he didn't have any working video game console or TV and I gave him a computer?  Everyone else at the nursing home was too old for him in many ways, and he was 19 years old and at a nursing home with a bunch of old people left and right.  How about how I worked with the police at the college to catch and stop pedophiles and monsters of sorts from being at that place?  I shouldn't say more as it digs up police cases and restricted police business that I have obligations to this day to not disclose without authorization, but I was involved in stopping such monsters at that college.  How about in high school how I didn't ruin the lives of people there, not just those who became candidates and-or chosen?  How about how I was and wasn't a monster to the students and classmates there?  How many times do I have to be judged on these things I wonder?  By comparison, what about Diane Minnery and her family, Ruth Fielder and her family, the Tanners including Luke Tanner, the Keldermann family, and myself who have been victimized by what I've called the dark trio who are secretive and tight-lipped and dangerous, and ruin and wreck what and who they touch, and avoid doctors like the plague and only go to a doctor paying out of pocket to avoid any paper trail with insurance?  How am I compared to them?  Notice how I'm not one of them?  Notice how I'm not like them?  What else do I, this monster of sorts, have to explain, with all the things I've been accused of by telepathic operators?  How am I supposedly evil, and how are the dark trio supposedly innocent 'saviors' of sorts?  You be the judge on who rooted for the wrong team and misjudged me and them.

	I was on Abilify ONLY for over twelve and a half years and doing great on that, no psych issues according to more than one doctor [Zuchowski and Alamir], and working and driving and more, and doing far better than when on Clozaril and antipsychotic meds of other types, and doctors and nurses know that abilify-only would do nothing for actual schizophrenia, and abilify really works for mood disorders, and people are often misdiagnosed or given alternate diagnosis apparently, etc, as one nurse from Cleveland Visiting Nurses was explaining to me, and she said I do NOT have schizophrenia, she said NO WAY and was very assertive about it, and she said what shows in medical paperwork is not a proper diagnosis but that stuff was happening quite a bit in the 1990s and for someone my age was quite common, and I photographed her business card and name etc and have it, including what was and might still be her phone number, also Zuchowski wanted me off ALL medications including the abilify at least twice and discussed it with me in appointments

	Type about being unwanted child, 'You had to be sick' and asthma etc, and all the doctor appts and medicines and how she wanted to 'be paid' for all of it and took her anger out on me, also left out of all planning and itenerary for family not just with vacations, and Paul was raised to be superior and I was ignored and shunned, also 'pretend love' with anger and reluctance and how the King would always heave sighs of reluctance and be upset and disgruntled to give 'pretend love', etc, and Paul supported with pretend career no matter what and allowed to have debt and be unsustainable without both parents and inheritance money and assets over the years, and how he was pulled out of psych after diagnosed at a university where he was given diagnosis and the queen knew how to 'make it go away' and keep him out of treatment, and the prince avoids doctor appointments including basic checkups like the plague and the three of them are VERY careful about what goes to health insurance and they pay for stuff for themselves out of pocket for healthcare to avoid a paper trail in health insurance, and the queen's copaxone injections for her multiple sclerosis that made her moody and angry and aggressive at times and very combative and threatening frequently, and these are dangerous warning side effects according to websites on both MS and copaxone and other professional and medical websites yet her doctors don't even know over the years [long period of time] and don't know how dangerous she's become

	'We went with the wrong camp' when I still had my apartment and how it showed that it was known how the Reeves family was involved and behind Type Five, known back then, and that I was misidentified then realized to be innocent, and 'Sal's Arm' and the other two of the dark trio had a lot of confessing to do and were guilty of a lot much like the dark queen, and back then this was known and realized.  Also, I was identified as the 'unwanted child' and Dylan and his group found this out and understood.  That was when I got to Cleveland Clinic and Type Five was still going on, and so were the cruelties and evils of the dark queen and dark king and dark prince, while I was being victimized by them the whole time and people and vehicles on roads while moving were being vaporized and teleported and experiencing phasing, and I felt shock and horror, and I was passive and simply enduring everything, and not doing anything, and very innocent the whole time while being victimized in so many ways, while the three of the dark trio were putting themselves in positions of further power over me and making themselves able to condemn and hurt me even more in so many ways, and a combination of misled and corrupt officials were allowing these things to happen and actively making it even worse at times.  No wonder some lost more than their clearance.  If I had not been bullied and victimized so badly and so intensely Type Five and the resulting vaporizations and side effects and teleporting and investigations from it and other stuff I still don't understand would not have happened.  If no one likes intense feelings of shock and horror and distress from my head overloading their computers, then I shouldn't be bullied and victimized so badly, of course.  That's a no-brainer, duh.  My so-called excuse for a 'family' doesn't love me and never did and is very dangerous and breaks laws in shocking ways that victimize me and has a huge number of 'skeletons in the closet' as the saying goes and has much to hide.  Also their ways of being so influential and convincing on human beings is unnatural and head-turning and should be attracting a lot more attention and investigation, and lacks innocence, and isn't safe.  I don't forget these things and I don't think I ever will.  I can't DO anything about them though and instead am powerless.  Others have to DO SOMETHING as they victimize and discredit me as I witness and watch them influence human beings left and right and no one DOES anything and no one else seems to notice either but SHOULD.

	'Distress call' during Type Five - Well, I was being squeezed and crushed, and not getting help for it that I needed, and that help still never came, so what would anyone expect of course?  Who could blame me?  I'm noticing that I stand uncorrected and still innocent.  Also, I'm still allowed to be arrogant, so that's still not any issue, I'd guess.

NOHS Yearbook, out of 423 freshman photos, 20 have looks at a single quick glance to become sky children if the criteria is close to or like that of the chosen.  That's about 4.728 percent.  For sophmmores, 10 faces out of 379, roughly 2.639 percent.

Notes: Felines, pets, work animals, livestock, two-faced dark queen, dark queen's psychopathy and her issues and medications and refusals where she said she doesn't need any therapy or psychiatry and she thinks she can 'heal herself' as she said over the years

Hand motions from a 'spiritual stephanie' that were like ones from 'johnny mnemonic' and 'psychic talk' with fingers together and thumb like a mouth opening and closing, 'stephanie' tight-knit with hostile spiritual 'Jean Hays' and Russia, very first discreditor, routed all my thoughts to her and her hand moving in renders, said it was speaking in 'Russian' and 'spy talk', very forceful, I had no way to stop or overpower it, and she/he/they did this starting in my old apartment 505 in North Olmsted and kept doing it for quite some time, during and throughout and after Type Five started and ended and he/she/they kept doing it.  There was information it may have actually gone to Russia and-or spies.  The same 'stephanie' was supposed to be removed, ordered by spiritual 'James Hetfield', and she was also the very 'first discreditor' who claimed she wasn't supposed to be allowed to be removed, supposedly, and could supposedly do what she wanted to without any overseers or controls or accountability, and be corrupt and hostile and no one could supposedly remove her [I was just told she was eventually dealt with and removed, or at least 'they think they did'.].

As of 2020-02-27 16:03 EST I have NOT been educated on what a 'spy game' or 'simulation' is or how it works or what I am supposed to do with multiple phone numbers for people including pretend phone numbers.  I'm still waiting to be told what this stuff is and how it works with what will be brand-new first-time information.  I am also unclear on what a 'control factor' is and still need to be given this type of information.  I do NOT have this information already, at all whatsoever!  Honest, scout's honor.  If operators don't believe what's real then can they please tell me anyways?
