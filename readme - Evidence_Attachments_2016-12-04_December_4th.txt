Industry Relationships
Cleveland Clinic physicians and scientists may collaborate with the pharmaceutical or medical device industries to help develop medical breakthroughs or provide medical
expertise or education. Cleveland Clinic strives to make scientific advances that will benefit patient care and support outside relationships that promise public benefit. In
order for the discoveries of Cleveland Clinic physicians' and scientists' laboratories and investigations to benefit the public, these discoveries must be commercialized in
partnership with industry. As experts in their fields, Cleveland Clinic physicians and scientists are often sought after by industry to consult, provide expertise and education.
To assure professional and commercial integrity in such matters, Cleveland Clinic maintains a program that reviews these collaborations and, when appropriate, puts

measures in place to minimize bias that may result from ties to industry. Cleveland Clinic publicly discloses the names of companies when (i) its physicians/scientists
receive $5,000 or more per year (or, in rare cases, equity or stock options) for speaking and consulting, (ii) its physicians/scientists serve as a fiduciary, (iii) its
physicians/scientists receive or have the right to receive royalties or (iv) its physicians/scientists hold any equity interest for the physician's/scientist's role as inventor,
discoverer, developer, founder or consultant.* In publicly disclosing this information, Cleveland Clinic tries to provide information as accurately as possible about its
physicians' and scientists' connections with industry.
As of 9/2/2016, Dr. Waters has reported no financial relationship with industry that is applicable to this listing. In general, patients should feel free to contact their doctor
about any of the relationships and how the relationships are overseen by Cleveland Clinic. To learn more about Cleveland Clinic's policies on collaborations with industry
and innovation management, go to our Integrity in Innovation page.
Public Health Service-Reportable Financial Conflicts of Interest. Cleveland Clinic scientists and physicians engage in basic, translational and clinical research activities,
working to solve health problems, enhance patient care and improve quality of life for patients. Interactions with industry are essential to bringing the researchers’
discoveries to the public, but can present the potential for conflicts of interest related to their research activities. Click here <LINK: http://my.clevelandclinic.org

Health Service (PHS)-Reportable Financial Conflict of Interest and has put measures in place to ensure that, to the extent possible, the design, conduct and reporting of the
research is free from bias.
* Cleveland Clinic physicians and scientists subscribe to the guidance presented in the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals and the AdvaMed Code
of Ethics on Interactions with Health Care Professionals. As such, gifts of substantial value are generally prohibited.

04/24/16
Mother,
I can see both of our lives have certainly gone down a path different than most, how we have
never quite had a “typical family” in any common sense, and how so many things could have very well
gone in very different directions. Many of these different directions very well could have been much
better ones, it really is a shame that some badly needed changes were not made earlier, and that many
changes now necessary would not have to potentially come to pass had some bad choices not been
made long ago.
Life is a non-stop learning process, lessons always being learned, with the next day bringing
new lessons, new things to learn, while at the same time applying that which has already been learned,
from experience, observation, refection on past choices and situations, to the results that luck, fate, and
how situations were handled may bring.
One key thing about this process is the fact that this process is continual on all sides, there is no
situation in which two or more people in a relationship are truly in a one-sided teaching vs. learning
scenario – One where only one can be a “student” and another can supposedly be just a “teacher” - with
the one in the role of the “teacher” or superior ever having any place or right to consider themselves as
having nothing more to learn, supposedly “knowing all there is to know,” supposedly always having
any “right” or “true” answer to any question without need of correction or re-examination of an issue.
I remember you’ve always said to me how “I have a lot to learn” and yet always applied this
concept to myself or others, never openly accepting the advice of others over your own, never
accepting that something you think or feel could ever need to be re-thought, or given another look,
based upon input or advice from another.
This also reminds me of how you even used to admit openly that if I say something, note an
observation or truth of sorts, that you always told me that my words were “something you couldn’t
accept in your head” because they were from another person – instead of your own thoughts – and
therefore were rejected and discarded in favor of your own views and judgments which you had
always felt so strongly had to be right and could never tolerate being corrected, wrong, or subject to
second thoughts.
I have tried to work with you on all matters of life in conversation and more for as long as I can
remember, yet have seen how you insist and demand to always have the last word, always an upper
hand of sorts, while sitting on a self-appointed throne to speak down to others from, then doing
whatever you so please with any action being “justified” for the most vague rationalization, your
actions apparently never subject to being wrong or immoral, as if, in the end, even the fact that such
decisions were from your own mind and no other person’s, that such alone was supposedly enough in
itself to claim that you were doing a “rightful” thing, never accepting that your own view on matters
could be very harmful, very damaging, or very poor judgments on your part.
I have seen you tell myself and others numerous bits of advice meant to teach or demonstrate
various life lessons over the various years, yet in each and every case you always pushed such concepts
and lessons quite aggressively on others, while “removing” yourself from such situations as if you were
not subject to rules or morals which everyone else was subject to, as if you and you alone are
supposedly not subject to any rules or restrictions which you forcefully made sure everyone else around
you and beyond are subject to.
Some lessons are rather basic, ones that need to be learned and mastered at a very early stage of
life, ones that separate a mature person from a wild, unruly, small child.

These lessons are all relevant, they all must be learned and applied at certain key points in life,
and there are never certain lessons which can truly be skipped or left out of the whole process! To
move forward onto later stages, to “graduate” to the next “class,” one can never simply “pick and
choose” which lessons to learn and apply, while shunning and refusing to study for others.
I can see now that you yourself still have much to learn about certain matters, that even now
you still lack certain “prerequisites” for the next “class” - lessons which you should have passed the
exam for many years ago.
I have seen these problems for a long time, hoping you would eventually learn these lessons and
fill in the “holes” in your “record” of life-long education.
Unfortunately, time and time again I’ve seen a complete and utter refusal to accept such a
reality, a very stubborn, very defiant response to such matters, a refusal to learn certain things you
really need to move forward.
Your refusal has certainly been costly, and quite damaging, not just for yourself, but for myself
and others as well. I’ve seen long years of your suffering through painful, extreme, and long-lasting
emotional outbursts along with a catastrophic failure to handle yourself and handle basic stress, the
most simple daily problems that come up in life.
I’ve seen how for so many years you have been moody, lashing out at others with a hair-trigger
temper, failing to show up for work or appointments on-time invariably, over-reacting to even basic
problems which come up, and refusing to take responsibility on a simplistic level and making excuses
afterward which you feel are sufficient to remove yourself from fault of any kind.
I’ve watched as your struggles have been overpowering for you at times, in extreme ways, to
the point where they take a heavy toll on your body in a physical sense, the demons in your own mind,
the failure for certain parts of your mental, and spiritual self, to develop past a primitive state while
never moving forward.
Spiritual development requires continual development to function properly, and one that does
not progress, one that chooses to refuse moving forward, stubbornly refusing further progress and
accept the need of effort to move further, all results in a spirit and inner self which stagnates, festers,
and self-corrupts in many ways.
When this sort of catastrophic dysfunction occurs, it becomes increasingly difficult to repair, to
recover, to go back and learn such failed lessons and move forward properly. Taken to an extreme, it
can have serious consequences, damaging ones which not only “spill over” outside of the mental
consciousness of one’s mind that can no longer contain an ever-growing problem, to a point where very
physical manifestations appear, in the form of illness, poor health, and physical sickness tied to extreme
stress, pain, poor sleep, and much more, well beyond anything easily explained by any neurologist or
medical professional of any discipline.
I’ve been concerned for a long time, seeing this struggle withing yourself, a refusal to heal it, a
response to such an issue with a “giving up” attitude and letting the problem grow further, consuming
who you are, the very self you should have grown up into through life, replaced by something less than
what it should have been, less than what it could have been, something lacking and incomplete to a
point of extreme self-corruption.
I’ve seen this profound list of problems spill out even further, feeding off each other while
feeding off yourself as well, then others around you, not just the family and friends that could have
been, but then onward, to long-held relationships that falter and erode, to negative reactions from
others, hostilities, and more.
I can’t help but notice that as you continue to fall apart into a horrific demise on so many levels,
that many long-time friends and relationships change in ways which are too often not for the better.

Diane Minnery, who had been a long-time close friend, someone who shared herself and her
family with you in so many ways, has apparently distanced herself from you, making certain changes
out of regret, sad after a painful departure from your life.
Ruth Fielder, another of what was once your close inner-circle of friends, along with her family,
is now left distressed, fearful, unwilling to trust her doctors and family, reduced to a nervous wreck of
sorts while not knowing who to turn to.
Both these people, and their families, had once been very close friends, rather stable to begin
with, both of them always around and available as job references, emergency contacts, and more.
I’ve seen others distance themselves or have struggles with your problems in very short-term
situations as well. I recall when you were working on getting a stationary exercise bike together, had
some technical issues with assembly, and were calling for tech support on the machine, with me
holding another phone on the same line in case you wanted “help” with something mechanical or
technical in nature. The support receptionist on the line had answered the call quickly, with a bright,
good-nature sort of warm and friendly tone, trying to be very helpful, and yet you were being difficult,
quickly lashing out angrily over basic questions on the model of the exercise bike, registration for
warranty, and more. The support representative tried bending over backwards, even going a little
farther than he had to in an effort to help, and yet you were lashing out further in an aggressive tirade of
hostility and anger. After the phone call you were ranting about the support representative “having
issues” of sorts, accusing him of “not having his act together” and more.
I recall when your home suffered storm damage, and when moving things around for repairs
and remodeling purposes you had been accusing the workers who came of stealing things from your
home, some of which I noticed later after the work was done, in disorganized boxes and areas where
you had lost track of some things.
I’ve seen you leap to such conclusions – accusing others so quickly of having “mental issues”
left and right – over many years with many people around you. I’ve seen my father erode with getting
older, having frequent “senior moments” which you take and use to contrive accusations of deceit,
various “mental disorders” tied to the “dark triad” while putting him on the spot for many personal
qualities you show yourself.
In the same way, nearly all these accusations you aggressively use against others, lashing out,
are over issues and personal characteristics you show with your own words and intense emotions.
I myself recall far too many times when you made phone calls, or sent messages, letters, and
more talking to me as if I had issues that were showing in your actions! Too many times I was left
thinking “Geez, look who’s talking...”
Many of these actions you label others for having go beyond mental illness, or any illness at all.
Some go into basic concepts of being responsible, being honest, and such. Some reach as far as
“lectures” given to others on morals and right vs. wrong, when the reason such lectures come up is
because of actions on your part, and not the person you are giving the lecture to.
It seems that every single symptom, problem, or issue which surfaces in yourself is something
you deny and refuse to recognize, then “attach” to someone else, claiming that such problems are
always present in others but never yourself.
I can’t help but notice that you also compound these problems, adding to them and worsening
them with self-indulgence in self-centered illicit behavior, some of them ending up being very serious
and very criminal in nature. These actions too are ones which you refuse to view as “wrong” or
improper in any way, something which is always “justified” with even the most vague rationalizations.

I’ve seen you fall into a pattern of making pawns of what could have been kept as friends, then
pitting them against each other, each one left with a somewhat different story on matters, different
contrived “facts” and misinformation, to a point where your former friends are left in ruin and demise,
and newer relationships quickly become short-term and toxic in nature.
More recently, these problems have left you lashing out at others more, quickly rushing to a
“defense” as if always expecting an attack or accusation of sorts from others around you.
I have not mentioned the term “abuse” for years, and yet you had quickly brought it up in a
flash, as if you were expecting an accusation of such.
In the same way, it seems you’ve been expecting me to sue you in civil court over one or more
of these matters, along with the vast financial empire and entire life you have worked so hard to keep
from me, hide from me, and keep me out of while covering it with lies and manipulation.
I’ve seen you respond with calculated lies and answers, thought-out lies upon lies, creating a
“paper-trail” of a long list of fraudulent claims and misinformation, yet with so many of these
contrived, false facts being inconsistent with each other, in a constantly changing story with a history
which suddenly flips around to an alternate one in whole, over and over again, sometimes within the
same conversation.
A few short evenings ago when I had stopped at your place, I saw you change stories, change
everything you claimed was “true” or had supposedly happened repeatedly, presenting more than a
dozen versions of entire family histories within a few minutes, then finally resorting to “not being able
to remember anything” with any excuse possible to avoid being honest.
I recall you having an interest in other “files” and “documents” which have surfaced. While it
is true that I only showed you a few of what I had brought, a small “sample” at best, the truth is that
there is far more going around, left behind in documents, records, and more which in totality would not
begin to fit in any one briefcase, or even be enough that any one person could handle or carry such a
load of paperwork.
A good deal of these records are in the hands of others as well – former friends of yours, former
pawns of yours, accountants and financial investors, doctors and other medical professionals who had
known or worked with yourself as well as myself, and more.
I’ve seen a number of other such people distance themselves in similar ways, or change their
methods, putting themselves on the defensive, having concerns over your actions, your emotions, your
darkening and worsening personality as a whole, with you becoming more of a hollowed-out and
artificial person, increasingly incomplete and corrupted as a whole.
I’ve seen you become more materialistic in nature as you fall farther down this spiral of evil
ways, making frantic grabs for money and power without earning or working for any of it, refusing to
be responsible while feeling “entitled” to some “prize” or “reward” for things you never worked toward
or earned in any sense, wanting the payoff in return for refusing to work for it.
At the same time, your self-corruption has cost you your own health in so many ways to the
point where you are unable to make money, work or get a job to generate money, and yet you make
more and more frantic grabs for cash and material assets which others have earned, which others have
worked for, which you were never entitled to in the first place. In many cases, especially more recent
ones, you have fought to grab a hold of wealth, power, honor, and respect which by right should be held
by others, which never should have been placed in your hands at all, in the slightest.
I’ve seen you always blame others for these actions, and even when confronted you simply
change your whole story once again, with each newly re-vamped tale being one where you supposedly

are never at fault, where supposedly you never did any harmful act of wrong-doing, supposedly never
stole or robbed others, and supposedly never hurt anyone else or lied about anything.
You kept asking for more of the files and records, much in the same way you kept entering my
apartment and home without authorization, even long after telling you directly and explicitly not to do
so, that I would never tolerate such action.
At the same time, you have always been extremely tight-lipped and secretive of all documents
or proof of any kind whatsoever backing up any of your stories, coming up with any information to
verify any of what you claim to have happened.
This refusal of any records or information supporting your claims, this constant, non-stop series
of responses where you are telling ever-changing stories and tales, while always insisting that others
and myself should always just “take your word for it” - all the time while demanding proof of real facts
and real information brought forth by anyone else, especially myself – This ever-lasting, sickening
pattern of corrupt, on-going behavior with no end in sight – This overall has gone too far, in such an
extreme way that it simply cannot be allowed to continue.
This is where change is needed. This isn’t “change” of the sort as it was done in the past for so
long, it isn’t the type of “change” where you pretend to agree to a set of terms, and then attempt to alter
such conditions to your liking whenever you desire. I recall when one counselor had worked out a
written, then typed out list of terms we should both agree on and commit to. I had always been willing
to hold my end up with full responsibility, yet time and time again you did whatever you pleased, even
responding to comments about your actions with “Oh, I’m changing the ‘agreement’...”
I have to say, this parallels in many ways to a scene from the classic Star Wars films, where the
primary antagonist of the plot, the “evil overlord” known as Darth Vader, changes a deal mid-stream to
his liking while at the same time self-assuming the role of judge and referee on the matter.
I’ve seen this in yourself as well, the act of taking on a self-assumed role of judge, jury, and
entire “court” all in yourself, with myself always being a single, solitary “litigant” who is always left
on a “losing” side with a failed case that has “no merit” to it.
I’ve seen you do this with other people as well, victimizing others in our “family” that shouldbe yet in some ways really isn’t, as well as people outside any relatives, family friends, and even
professionals who manage financial accounts and medical records.
Too many times you have even been confronted with mistakes, misjudgments where you are
clearly incorrect – in many cases proven wrong by very real evidence of the fact – and yet you
aggressively push forward brutal, ruthless methods to force yourself to “win” such arguments and make
yourself come out as “right.” Often you do this by “pulling rank” or by making threats and backing
them up with very real actions where you abuse your position in situations, with horrifying corrupt
actions.
This change is something a bit different. This is one which is very badly needed, one where not
all of the choices made will be by yourself, one where you actually have to accept the judgment handed
down by another, where you actually must play by certain rules that you long refused to accept while
forcing them upon others.
At some point you need to take responsibilities for your actions. There’s an old concept of
justice, one known as “If you don’t want to do the time, don’t do the crime.” In the same way, when
you do things which are wrong, improper, or in some ways are not within rules, laws, and more, at
some point you need to accept guilt for your wrongdoing, you need to recognize that you are the one at
fault for resulting outcomes, and these are things that you can’t just pass on to others or blame others
for. Like everyone else on the planet, you are subject to such rules, laws, and such, and cannot forever

escape justice or accountability for your actions. You cannot always claim that your actions are
“justified” in any sense, or something you shouldn’t have to be held responsible for due to any
rationalization.
These things are also subject to judgment by another! When you are facing “accusations” for
your actions, when myself or others point out your poor choices, you cannot assume the role of the
entire “court” while also being a “defendant” at the same time!
Of course you would always consider yourself “not guilty” of any wrong-doing on your part – if
it was your position or place to decide the matter. A good many people who break rules would do so.
I’ve seen this tendency, this selfish quality in others before. I’ve always been a supporter of
justice, fighting for good, helping people in need, and protecting victims and the innocent. I’ve always
been this way, this has never changed, in the same way I don’t tolerate corruption or misuse of power.
I recall recently, as well as many times in past years when you brought up a long-past event
years ago when I was concerned about homeless people at a public holiday display, concerned about
them in a caring manner. This was always something you criticized me for, something you “blamed”
me for, making my caring nature, my drive to help the needy something of a “fault” I should be
“shamed” for.
In the same way, you have often “blamed” and “shamed” me in anger, over many years, for
caring about protecting the innocent, and having a drive to stop and fight corruption and criminals, for
being willing to fight back against evil in any and all forms.
I’ve also had a drive to be responsible, to put my money where my mouth is, to get the job done
and really work for things. I never favored getting some “prize” or “reward” without earning it or
working for it. These things too, and much more, were also things that you criticized as “faults” of
mine, things I was “guilty” of.
In a like way, I have long accepted that money isn’t everything, and a willingness to get
something done that really needs to be done – especially if no one else is willing – regardless of any
expectation of any reward or payback at all in many cases.
I don’t mind doing that. I’ve never minded doing that, working for the good of the many,
protecting people who are vulnerable, doing things the right way while standing up to the many faces
of evil and corruption in all manifestations. I’ve always been concerned primarily with getting the job
done, doing the good while leaving any payback or reward as an afterthought of sorts, something with a
lesser priority, in many cases something that doesn’t even need to be accomplished as it isn’t the most
important goal to myself. This, too, is another “fault” from your perspective, something I’m “guilty” of
and something I should be “punished” for in your view.
I could go on for a long while with these issues and more, although much of it you already
know, yet refuse to openly accept on a conscious level. These things and more are things which have
shown to be very true, very real, while you have always wanted so hard for them to be a “perspective”
or “opinion” which should bow to your own viewpoint – a viewpoint which you have always pushed as
one which “must” be accepted as more “right” and factual in nature than any other.
I’ve been long concerned about these issues – issues of yours, which originate from yourself,
not from myself or others.
I’ve also seen others being concerned with your issues as well – from doctors, to financial
workers, to former friends of yours, and much more.
I’ve also seen you pretend to have faith and morals, pretend to have values of some sort, while
in reality refusing to practice what you preach.
Related to this is how you have not only been very invasive of the personal matters of others,
such as myself, as you are constantly demanding to know what bank and financial accounts I have
where, always demanding statements and balances, insisting on micromanaging all of my personal
affairs to an extreme level, while at the same time being so extremely tight-lipped and secretive

regarding your own finances to a point where I never am supposed to know how much you make or
even where you had supposedly worked, you refuse to tell me anything or

Abuse or Neglect
Through Deliberate
Problem
Falsification/Deception
Louisa J. Lasher is an internationally-recognized
expert in the identification, intervention, and case
management of Munchausen by Proxy (MBP),
also known as Factitious Disorder by Proxy (FDP)
and other terms/labels that mean the same or
similar. She also provides consultations and
educational programs on this topic for legal,
medical and community services groups.
Lasher is not a “hired gun.” She has been
providing expert services in this kind of
maltreatment since 1993, always seeking the
truth of each situation.

A Dangerous Kind of
Maltreatment...
People refer to this subject area by many names,
and sub-names as depicted below. The overall
umbrella term used by Lasher for all of the terms
and labels is child or adult maltreatment
(abuse or neglect) through deliberate
problem falsification/deception - with all of
those other terms falling under it
The area of concern includes terms/labels that
mean maltreatment to self or to others (children,
adults, or animals). For example:
Munchausen by Proxy (MBP)
Factitious Disorder by Proxy (FDP)
Malingering by Proxy
Pediatric Condition Falsification (PCF)
Medical Child Abuse
Fabricated or Induced Illness
Factitious Disorder
Munchausen Syndrome
Other labels that mean the same or
similar.
Deliberate tactics to alienate, and/or false
accusations, are frequently part of the overall
falsification/deception pattern.
Louisa is available to provide training, case
consultation, technical assistance, and expert
witness services in an objective manner (no
partiality to either side) and in the best interest

Child or Adult
Maltreatment through
Problem
Falsification/Deception
(Including sub entities/terms, for example:
Munchausen by Proxy Maltreatment, Factitious
Disorder by Proxy, Malingering by Proxy, Mixed
Cases (that include both the two previous terms),
Pediatric Condition Falsification, and other
terms/labels that mean the same or similar).
The generic term/label/entity, if confirmed and has
caused - or may cause - negative consequences to
the victim - stands alone as a very dangerous kind
of maltreatment – with or without the use of
sub-entities/terms.

Definitions, Maltreatment
Behaviors, and Comments

Now Available:
Check out the latest book by Louisa J.
Lasher and Mary Sheridan...
Munchausen by Proxy:
Identification, Intervention, and
Case Management is the first book to
walk you step-by-step through a
suspected MBP maltreatment case, from
suspicion onward.

Child or adult maltreatment (abuse or neglect)
through deliberate problem falsification/deception
is simply my generic, descriptive, informal term
for a particular pattern of behavior that includes
one or a combination of the following behaviors
described below. I use this overall, umbrella term
because of so many terms being used throughout
the world – some mean the same thing – some
don’t mean the same thing depending on the
concept used, and the terms, meanings, and
criteria change, depending on the individual using
the particular term. “Terminology confusion”
continues to evolve.
All terms used include perpetration of one or more
of the following behaviors. One or more of these
falsification behaviors constituting child or adult
maltreatment must first be established – prior to
attempts to determine “the why” of the behavior,
and to use any of the sub-terms.

Exaggerate:
The perpetrator embellishes a genuine
physical and/or psychological-behavioralemotional-mental health problem.
Fabricate:
(A) The perpetrator makes up/concocts a
physical and/or psychological-behavioralemotional-mental health problem story –
AND/OR (B) makes it look as if a problem
exists when, in fact, the problem does not

http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm

exist.
Induce:
The perpetrator causes/creates
/exacerbates a physical and/or
psychological-behavioral-emotional-mental
health problem.

Comments
1. This kind of abuse and/or neglect – including its
sub types/labels – is not currently an officially
recognized mental health diagnosis by the
American Psychiatric Association - it is a
recognized kind of maltreatment. There is no
mental health test or evaluation that can
determine whether a person is or is not a
perpetrator of this kind. However, this is a
recognized kind of abuse and/or neglect.
2. Different words, meaning the same behaviors
as above, are sometimes used – for example
“feign or “create”.
3. Virtually any problem an individual is alleged to
“have” or “have had “can be falsified (exaggerated
and/or fabricated and/or induced).
4. Situations may be exaggerated and/or
fabricated and/or induced as a part of the pattern.
5. The falsification behavior may include deliberate
tactics to alienate the victim from one or more
others. (I do not use the term or concept,
“parental alienation syndrome”.)
6. The falsification behavior may include deliberate
false allegations by the perpetrator - (including
exaggerating and/or fabricating and/or inducing
one or more problems with regard to the victim).
For example, sexual abuse (as a problem or
suspected problem) may be exaggerated and/or
fabricated and/or induced.
7. One or a combination of exaggeration,
fabrication, and induction may occur in a
particular case situation – and one or more of the
falsification behaviors and problem” may change
from time to time – as may the methodology. The
behaviors may begin and progress in any order.
8. Any one of the three falsification behaviors
(exaggeration, fabrication, and induction) may
result in negative impact to the victim – past,
present, or into the future. Exaggeration and/or
fabrication cases should be considered as
potentially deadly as those where induction is
involved.
9. Exaggeration and/or fabrication kinds of
problems should be considered as serious – and
potentially harmful to the victim – as cases
involving induction.
10. Genuine problems may co-exist with falsified
problems.

Louisa Lasher, Maltreatment Through Problem Fal...

http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm

11. Genuine problems may exist – but may also
be exaggerated and/or fabricated and/or induced.
12. Any suspicion of this kind of maltreatment
should result in assignment at the highest risk
level, regardless of how the case currently appears
to present. What is presently known or suspected
well may be only the tip of the iceberg.
13. Suspicion should be reported at its earliest
stages. Hospital staff and other professionals
should not wait until they think they can “prove”
the behavior.
14. Genuine physical and/or psychologicalbehavioral-emotional-mental health problems may
occur completely separate from the problem
falsification/deception behavior – or the
perpetrator may exaggerate and/or fabricate
and/or induce problems in addition to genuinely
existing problems.
15. This very dangerous kind of abuse or neglect
manifests as physical abuse and/or emotional
abuse and/or sexual abuse and/or various kinds of
neglect – depending on the individual case
circumstances and the terms and definitions in the
legal statutes of the particular area. It is
imperative that confirmed abuse or neglect of this
kind be linked to the kinds and definitions of
maltreatment contained in the jurisdiction’s legal
statutes.
16. Specialized knowledge, investigative activities,
and methodology must be utilized. The vast
majority of professionals, even those highly
regarded and/or well known, do not have the
expertise necessary to work with a suspected or a
confirmed case of this kind.
This kind of abuse or neglect is very different from
other kinds of maltreatment. Working
appropriately with suspected or confirmed cases of
this kind requires specialized knowledge and skills
from suspicion onward through the life of the case.
17. It is a misconception that most cases of this
type are suspected or occur in a hospital or other
inpatient atmosphere. It is my experience that the
vast majority of cases present in the outpatient
setting.
18. It is a misconception that proof of this kind of
maltreatment must include secret audio and/or
video surveillance. Certainly recorded behavior
can be “icing on the cake” but not necessary – if a
thorough and appropriate investigation and
determination process is completed.

Criteria for Confirming
Problem Falsification
3 of 12

Louisa Lasher, Maltreatment Through Problem Fal...

http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm

1. Criteria for confirming the generic term, child or
adult maltreatment (abuse or neglect) through
deliberate problem falsification/deception:
A. Evidence/proof (direct and/or
circumstantial - usually strong
circumstantial) of deliberate
exaggeration and/or fabrication
and/or induction of a physical
and/or psychological/behavioral
/emotional/mental health problem
(Evidence of the behavior).
B. Negative or risk of negative
impact on the victim due to
exaggeration and/or fabrication
and/or induction by the perpetrator.
Remember that if A and B are confirmed, the
individual has perpetrated very dangerous
child or adult maltreatment – and is very
likely to continue, in one way or another.
2. Criteria for confirming the sub entities (having
to do with the motivation, “the why” for the
proven behavior).
A. Evidence/proof (direct and/or
circumstantial - usually strong
circumstantial) of deliberate
exaggeration and/or fabrication
and/or induction of a physical
and/or psychological/behavioral
/emotional/mental health problem.
(As per Criteria 1 above).
B. Negative or risk of negative
impact on the victim due to
exaggeration and/or fabrication
and/or induction by the perpetrator
(as per Criteria 1 above.)
C. Depending on the sub entity
explained below, the kind or kinds
of needs the perpetrator was/is
attempting to meet through use of
the victim:
Munchausen by Proxy
Maltreatment, Munchausen
Syndrome by Proxy,
Munchausen by Proxy
Syndrome, and Factitious
Disorder by Proxy are terms
that mean the same thing –
unless the term and concept
of Pediatric Condition
Falsification is used.
Strong rationale that the
deliberate falsification
behavior is, primarily, an
attempt by the perpetrator
to meet his/her own
emotional/internal needs.
For example: attention,
sympathy, jealousy,

http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm

revenge, etc. This can
usually be accomplished as
result of an appropriate,
specialized investigation and
determination process by an
expert specific to this
subject area.
Malingering by Proxy
Maltreatment: Strong
rationale that the deliberate
falsification behavior is,
primarily, an attempt by the
perpetrator to meet his/her
own external needs. For
example money or other
resources/”stuff”. This can
usually be accomplished as
a result of an appropriate,
specialized investigation and
determination process by an
expert specific to this
subject area.
Mixed Cases: Strong
rationale that the deliberate
falsification behavior is an
attempt by the perpetrator
to meet both internal and
external needs. This can
usually be accomplished as
a result of an appropriate,
specialized investigation and
determination process by an
expert specific to this
subject area.

Pediatric Condition
Falsification – A Different
Concept, with Different
Terminology and Meanings
Pediatric Condition Falsification (PCF) concept
is a proposal that originated from an APSAC
(American Professional Society on the Abuse of
Children) task group.
I was instrumental in causing the creation of the
task group, was a member of the task group for a
time – but resigned due to what I felt were
significant problems with content and process –
and I was unwilling to lend my name as one of the
proposal authors. This term has not been accepted
- nor is it being used – within the overall
community of professionals who provide services
in this subject area. The following are major
differences between two concepts are compared
below:

MBP/FDP
Concept

PCF Concept

MBP and FDP do
MBP and FDP mean

thing.
Criteria 1 for
MBP/FDP
Maltreatment is
confirmed if there is
direct or
circumstantial
evidence of
deliberate
exaggeration and/or
fabrication and/or
induction behavior.

Confirmed
exaggeration and/or
and/or induction
behavior is called
Pediatric
Condition
Falsification (PCF)

Criteria 1
constitutes
maltreatment
behavior.

PCF constitutes
maltreatment
behavior.

Criteria 2 for
MBP/FDP
Maltreatment is met
if there is strong
rationale that the
exaggeration and/or
fabrication and/or
Induction behavior
qualifies as
MBP/FDP
Maltreatment –
rather than
something else. This
involves, in part,
looking at other
possible reasons for
the Criteria 1
behavior and having
rationale for ruling
out the other
possibilities.

The suspected
perpetrator is
“diagnosed” as
“having” Factitious
Disorder by Proxy
- mental health
diagnosis – but
there is no such
mental health
diagnosis.

MBP Does Not Mean The
Same Thing As PCF
1. Under the PCF concept, terminology is
different from the MBP/FDP concept – and
is confusing to most people.
2. The PCF concept is not widely used within
the major MBP Maltreatment community of
professionals.
3. The process leading to the PCF concept did
not include anywhere near the majority of
credible experts in the field – even though
some asked to provide input.
4. Determining MBP Maltreatment under the
PCF concept depends on a mental health
diagnosis – but there is no such mental
health diagnosis.
5. All situations where Criteria 1 behavior

Falsification) constitutes extremely
dangerous child abuse or neglect - but do
not necessarily qualify as MBP
Maltreatment.
Regardless of the label used – confirmation
of Criteria 1 (again, the same as PCF)
constitutes very, very serious child or adult
abuse or neglect – that manifests as
physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect
of various kinds – depending on the
wording of the particular state statutes.
MBP concept Criteria 1 does NOT equate to
the second part of the PCF concept. Under
both concepts the goal is to form an
opinion on what the exaggeration and/or
fabrication and/or induction behavior
constitutes. Under the PCF concept – a
decision that the behavior has been, for
the most part, due to internal/emotional
reasons – the part A behavior - would be
termed “Factitious Disorder by Proxy” - and
PCF plus FDP would equal Munchausen by
Proxy (MBP).
As discussed in detail above, none of these
terms or concepts has ever been placed in
DSM - IV by the American Psychiatric
Association as a formal mental health
diagnosis. Under the PCF concept, FDP is
considered a mental health diagnosis –
which is bogus.
If Criteria 1 is confirmed, it is important to
attempt to establish whether the behavior
constitutes MBP Maltreatment –
Malingering by Proxy Maltreatment –
overanxious/overprotective caregiver –
overwhelmed caregiver etc. Appropriate
case plan design is heavily impacted by
Criteria 2 findings - or lack of findings.
Criteria 2 methodology is more
comprehensive that the part two of the
PCF concept – and Criteria 2 does not, and
should not - rest on a mental health
evaluation.
There are times when it is not possible to
complete a Criteria 2 assessment in a short
period of time. I have designed a case
plan, with accompanying case
management, appropriate to that situation
as well as case plans appropriate to
findings.
I am fully aware that the above is very
confusing to most people – particularly as
a result of the changed terminology under
the PCF concept. That is one of the points I
am trying to make.

Some Major Suspicion
Indicators of Problem

7 of 12

11/05/2016 07:00 PM

Louisa Lasher, Maltreatment Through Problem Fal...

http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm

Falsification/Deception
1. Difference between reported history and
what is seen, or what makes sense
physically and/or psychologically,
emotionally, behaviorally, mental health.
2. Problem does not respond to treatment as
expected.
3. Problem appears to originate only in
association with suspected perpetrator’s
presence. This does not mean that the
suspected perpetrator must be in the room
with the suspected victim when the
problem(s) occurs or seems to occur.
4. Problem disappears or begins to improve
when suspected victim is separated from
suspected perpetrator.
5. Problem resumes after suspected
perpetrator is told suspected victim has
recovered, is improving, or is soon to be
released from the facility, program, course
of treatment, etc. – OR problem resumes
shortly after suspected victim goes home,
treatment is discontinued, etc.
6. Unexplained symptoms, illness, or death of
other nuclear or extended family members.
7. A pattern of “Usual Perpetrator
Characteristics” in combination with one or
more other suspicion indicators.
8. Behavior that appears to be consistent with
exaggeration and/or fabrication and/or
induction of physical and/or psychologicalbehavioral-emotional-mental health
problems regarding the suspected victim.

Common Perpetrator
Characteristics of Problem
Falsification (not a
“profile”)
Remember that direct and/or circumstantial
evidence proving BEHAVIOR is what should be
used to confirm “child or adult maltreatment
(abuse and/or neglect) through problem
falsification/deception.” There simply is no
“profile” that can serve as appropriate evidence
that a person is or is not a perpetrator of this kind.
I include this list only because there are some
individuals who think there is a “profile,” and that
a combination of the following “proves” the case
that someone is or is not this kind of perpetrator.
1. These perpetrators are usually mothers –
but not always.
2. These perpetrators usually present initially
as at least “normal”, “good” caregivers –
but not always.
3. These perpetrators are liars, deceivers,
and manipulators - and usually very
believable, convincing, and superb in their
ability to give seemingly plausible reasons

8 of 12

11/05/2016 07:00 PM

Louisa Lasher, Maltreatment Through Problem Fal...

http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm

for their behavior.
4. These perpetrators know what they are
doing. They are not simply overanxious
and/or over-protective caregivers. There is
a difference. For example: overanxious
and/or overprotective caregivers usually
stick close to the truth and express relief
when told their child does not have, or is
unlikely to have, the problem or problems
in question. This is frequently not true of
“problem falsification” perpetrators.
5. These perpetrators may have extensive
health care knowledge – or they may not.
6. These perpetrators usually deny all or part
of the maltreatment they have
perpetrated, even when there is extensive
evidence – but not always.
7. When perpetrators do admit, the admission
is usually only to what they have been
caught doing – but not to the overall
pattern of maltreatment
falsification/deception and/or to the related
pattern of falsification/deception within the
overall umbrella of their lives.
8. These perpetrators cannot be counted on
to stop their problem
falsification/deception behavior when they
are suspected or even caught - but the
behavior methodology may change as well
as the kind of problems they exaggerate
and/or fabricate and/or induce.
9. These perpetrators may add or change
health care providers or “doctor shop” - or
they may not.
10. These perpetrators may have “normal”
mental health evaluations - or there may
be identifiable mental health pathology.
11. These perpetrators may have a history of
problem falsification with regard to
themselves – or they may not.
12. These perpetrator-victim dynamics usually
initially appear on the surface to be good even excellent – but not always.
13. These perpetrators may or may not have
previous child protection or law
enforcement agency involvement.
14. These perpetrators should be considered
even more potentially dangerous than
before if/when they learn they are
suspected.
15. These perpetrators use their victims as
objects in trying to satisfy their own needs.
Needs may include trying to obtain internal
gain (for example: attention from one or
more others, professional and/or non
professional – sympathy – revenge – to be
seen by others as a hero caregiver, etc.)
-----or to seek external gain (for example:
financial gain, services, or other
“stuff”-----or to seek both internal and
external gain.
16. These perpetrators may have a “dramatic
flair” or be involved in exciting or dramatic
events….or they may not.
17. These perpetrators may change their

maltreatment methodology and/or the
“roblems they falsify – or they may not.

Victims
Victims can be of any age – and victims
may be children, adults, or even animals.
Victims do not usually know that this kind
of maltreatment has been perpetrated
upon them.
The youngest known victim was a fetus.
Most identified victims to date have been
young children.
When older children are identified as
victims, an appropriate and thorough
investigative process frequently reveals a
pattern that has been going on for a long
time.
Victims may or may not have further
problems (physical and/or psychologicalbehavioral-emotional-mental health) as a
result of the problem falsification/deception
behavior, and such problems may surface
immediately and/or into the future.
It is imperative that details of the
confirmed problem falsification/deception
history accompany victims into foster care,
relative placement, adoption, etc.

Spouses/Partners
/Relatives/Friends/Foster
Parents, etc.
One or more of these individuals very
frequently believes in and supports the
perpetrator - even when there is
overwhelming evidence of the problem
falsification/deception behavior. It is
unlikely that they will have the capacity to
be objective. It is also very unlikely that
they will comply with the kind of protection
procedures necessary – even if there is a
court order or they sign an agreement to
do so.
There may not have been a reason for
them to suspect any wrongdoing.
It is dangerous to place victims or potential
victims of this kind with those who do not
fully believe that the perpetration behavior
has occurred or, if there is not a definitive
finding yet, that the behavior may have
occurred. A specialized assessment, over
and above the usual process for approving
a placement, must take place as a part of
placement decision making. The old adage
“if you don’t believe, you won’t protect” is
never truer than with this kind of
maltreatment or maltreatment suspicion.

Factitious Disorder
(Including Munchausen
Syndrome)
1. It is important to differentiate between the
terms indicating maltreatment to others
from maltreatment regarding oneself.
Terms are often used incorrectly.
2. Factitious Disorder, including its sub type,
Munchausen Syndrome, is self abuse
and/or neglect in which an individual
deliberately exaggerates and/or fabricates
and/or induces physical and/or
psychological/behavioral/emotional/mental
health problems with regard to
himself/herself.
3. Individuals frequently use the term
“Munchausen”, “Munchausen’s”, or
Factitious Disorder when they are really
referring to maltreatment with regard to
others.
4. One must be careful to use the correct
term - and to question what is meant if the
term “Munchausen”, “Munchausen’s”, or
Factitious Disorder is used in written or
verbal form. I have been involved in
several court actions in which the cases
were temporarily dismissed due to use of
the wrong terminology and, hence, to the
wrong meaning.
5. Factitious Disorder/Munchausen Syndrome
is maltreatment to self.
6. Both falsification resulting to maltreatment
to self and falsification resulting
maltreatment to others may be present in
the same case situation.
The following figure is also from the Lasher –
Sheridan book. The generic term, child or adult
maltreatment (abuse or neglect) through
deliberate problem falsification/deception, was not
used in the book, but would overarch the items
indicated with a *.

Munchausen syndrome by proxy
Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a mental illness and a form of child abuse. The caretaker of a
child, most often a mother, either makes up fake symptoms or causes real symptoms to make it look
like the child is sick.

Causes
No one is sure what causes Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Sometimes, the person was abused
as a child or has Munchausen syndrome (fake illness for themselves).

Symptoms
The mother can do extreme things to fake symptoms of illness in her child. For example, she may:
Add blood to the child's urine or stool
Withhold food so the child looks like they can't gain weight
Heat up thermometers so it looks like the child has a fever
Make up lab results
Give the child drugs to make the child throw up or have diarrhea
Infect an intravenous line (IV) to make the child sick
What are signs in a mother?
Most people with this problem are mothers with small children. Some are adult children taking
care of an older parent.
The mother often works in health care and knows a lot about medical care. She can describe
the child's symptoms in great medical detail. She likes to be very involved with the health care

team and is liked by the staff for the care she gives her child.
These mothers are very involved with their children. They seem devoted to the child. This
makes it hard for health professionals to see a diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome by proxy.
What are signs in a child?
The child sees a lot of health care providers and has been in the hospital a lot.
The child often has had many tests, surgeries, or other procedures.
The child has strange symptoms that don't fit with any disease. The symptoms do not match
the test results.
The child's symptoms are reported by the mother. They are never seen by health care
professionals. The symptoms are gone in the hospital, but start again when the child goes
home.
Blood samples do not match the child's blood type.
Drugs or chemicals are found in the child's urine, blood, or stool.

Exams and Tests
To diagnose Munchausen syndrome by proxy, providers have to see the clues. They have to review
the child's medical record to see what has happened with the child over time. Very often,
Munchausen syndrome by proxy goes undiagnosed.

Treatment
The child needs to be protected. They may need to be removed from the direct care of the parent.
Children may require medical care to treat complications from injuries, infections, medicines,
surgeries, or tests. They also need psychiatric care to deal with depression, anxiety, and
post-traumatic stress disorder that can happen with child abuse.
Treatment most often involves individual and family therapy. Because this is a form of child abuse,
the syndrome must be reported to the authorities.

When to Contact a Medical Professional
If you think a child is being abused, contact a provider, the police, or child protective services.
Call 911 for any child in immediate danger because of abuse or neglect.

David,
I thought it was great when you were able to manage living in your apartment alone and
take care of most of the day to day things that came up as well as work and school. I'm
not sure if you've changed because of medical problems, mental health problems or the
combination of the two, but it has become very clear in the last year that at this time you
aren't able to manage all of these things on your own. It makes me really sad and I want
to give you the support you need to get you back to the point where you can be
independent again. Unfortunately, we disagree about this so you haven't wanted to use
support services. This has forced me to make some hard decisions:
1) Supplemental Funding- I will no longer give you monthly checks or pay for most
extra expenses as I have in the past UNLESS you resume meeting with ViaQuest staff (a
therapist and a case manager) a total of 5-6 times a month and I get documentation from
them. The purpose of these meetings would be to work on organization skills and
seeking less expensive housing with support services as well as any other concerns you
may have. ( You should be receiving another copy of their letter stating your case is
being closed due to lack of communication, but can be reopened at any time. You have
their contact info and can call at anytime.) If you resume services I will pay $300/mo until
you move or until June when your lease is up, which ever comes first. Remember your
dad says he will rent a truck and help you move.
2) Cell Phone- Apparently there have been ongoing problems with your cell phone. I will
continue to pay the monthly payments. Also, I'm happy to go with you to the Verizon
store to get a new one, pay for repairs or what ever is needed. The account number is
781814098-00001. I WILL ONLY BE IN TOWN FOR 7-10 MORE DAYS, SO IF YOU
NEED MY HELP LET ME KNOW ASAP.
3) Paying Psychiatrist- I called Dr. Alamir's office to arrange paying for your ongoing
visits and was told that they will be closing your case in 30 days because you've missed
too many appointments or called at the last minute to cancel (you will receive a letter).
You will have 30 days to get prescription refills. They can call in the Abilify, but the aderal
would need to be picked up.The ViaQuaest staff may be able to help you find another
psychiatrist or you might want to consider going back to MetroHealth Medical Center. It
isn't far on I-90 or perhaps John could drive you. If you want my help in the next 7-10
days with any of this let me know.

https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=57de...

4) Zyriem/Dr.Waters- Nancy, from Dr.Waters office, called as she hasn't been able to
reach you. The Zyriem company has tried for over a month to reach you by phone to do
patient counseling and confirm shipping details. You need to call 1-866-997-3688. I know
you have one appointment scheduled with Dr. Waters on 2/29 and another I think on 4/8
at 12:10. They may want to change them if you haven't taken the meds. I'm sure she'll
want sleep logs.Maybe John can drive you. Double check the dates on the computer as I
didn't write them down.
5) Visiting/Communicating - I am concerned about your well being and would like to
hear from you about how you're doing at least every 1-2 weeks by text or email. It can be
brief. Sometimes I do need to bring things over or come over to talk. Unless it's an
emergency, I'll send emails for 2-3 days stating that I'd like to come over and to arrange a
time. If I don't get a response I will come over and knock on the door as I have no way of
knowing if you're sick or injured.
I do wish the best for you.
Love,
Mom

Your dad and i got to NV OK. The cats were actually very good travelers. they got used
to the carriers and slept most of the day as they were often only half asleep during the
night watching guard. They seem to be settling in here OK. I hope you're doing well, too.

Your dad and I made it to NV in 4 days. The cats did very well in the car and in motels. They seem to be very
glad to be staying in one place. Paul seems to be very happy with his new girl friend. She has moved in with
her cat.
I hope you're doing ok.
Love,
Mom

About Deductibles and Catastrophic Cap:

1 of 2

Both are applied by fiscal year, which begins October 1 and ends September 30.
Annual deductibles do not apply to patients enrolled in TRICARE Prime.
Annual deductibles are applied to TRICARE For Life beneficiaries, if TRICARE For
Life is the primary payer.
The Prime beneficiary may self-refer to any TRICARE-certified (network or
non-network) provider without a referral from his or her PCM. Although a referral
is not required when using the Point of Service (POS) option, certain
01/10/2016 04:02 PM
preauthorization requirements still apply. When using the POS option, the

Tricare Eligibility and Costs

Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC). There is no Catastrophic Cap protection when
using the POS option.

Annual deductibles for individuals not enrolled

Fraud
How to Detect Fraud and What to do
If something doesn't seem right about your medical bills, for example, the same item
is billed twice or you've been billed for services you never received, here's what to
do:
• Double-check the billing from your provider of care and the Explanation of Benefits
(EOB) you received from WPS/TRICARE For Life. Be sure that the only services listed
are ones you actually received.
• If you can't resolve any problems you find by talking to the provider's billing office
(some discrepancies might simply be the result of errors in billing), or if you know or
have evidence of another individual, whether it be a provider of care or a TFL-eligible
person, submitting fraudulent claims to TFL, write to the program integrity unit at
reportit@wpsic.com.
For more information on fraud and abuse reporting please visit,

I apologize the inconvenience cause to you, let me check what best can be

I will help you with that, let me resolve the issue.

Selwyn Jamison: at 1:05:48
I will help you with it.

OK. Thanks. I apologize myself in advance if I'm grouchy or unfriendly, I'm in
a bad mood but I don't blame you personally.

Is the Modem from TWC or your own Modem.
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:06:37
Not a problem , I understand your situation.
David Reeves: at 1:08:30
OK, actually I have two modems - The new one which is a TWC phone modem
that I just got a few days ago in the mail but hasn't been activated, and the
1 of 3

https://sales.liveperson.net/hc/42897133/?cmd=ﬁ...

old modem which is one I own myself which still works and is what I'm
connected to right now for this chat. Both are connected via a coaxial
splitter, but my computer has ethernet connection to the old modem so I can
chat with you right now. I do not have wireless capability in my desktop
computer.
David Reeves: at 1:08:44
I also should point out one other thing Selwyn Jamison: at 1:09:15
Thank you for the brief information, let me go through it .
David Reeves: at 1:10:20
Many tech support companies consider me a "technical" or "advanced" user
because I used to be a computer tech professionally since 15 years ago or so,
and did assembly language programming on old Commodore computers as
far back as in the 1980s as a little kid. Today I code multi-platform software
and publish some stuﬀ too.
David Reeves: at 1:10:46
I'm also on Linux ATM.
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:11:09
Wow that's great.
David Reeves: at 1:13:09
I do have WINE installed though, and it can run some Windows-based
software as it is conﬁgured currently. I was able to partially install the CD
that came with the TWC phone modem and even extract the .chm help ﬁle.
The self install partially runs but I can't make it activate the new phone
modem, although it shows in the built-in web interface that it is indeed
talking to TWC servers, but just isn't activated/authorized for full use, which
is where I need help.
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:14:23
Okay, Could you please conﬁrm me the MAC address of the new Modem.
David Reeves: at 1:14:27
I do have the MAC address and other technical info available - but right now
I have no working phone at all as my old phone was already having issues
and is now totally non-functional.
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:15:47
I will look into the issue let me check if the new Modem is activated on the
account so please provide me the MAC address of the new Modem.
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:17:48
Not to rush you, are we connected?
David Reeves: at 1:18:06
OK, the new TWC phone modem is a Ubee MTA DVW3201B model, the MAC
address is 90489AFDA332 and the serial # is D6H2R46902352. Note that in
the initial web-access interface, it shows the MAC address as 90489AFDA330
along with a phone number (which I cannot call right now) for activation. (I
got the mail-order self-install kit). The old modem I'm chatting with right now
2 of 3

02/23/2016 01:30 AM

https://sales.liveperson.net/hc/42897133/?cmd=ﬁ...

is a ARRIS Surfboard.
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:18:25
Thank you.
David Reeves: at 1:19:17
Also, I do have a new land-line style basic phone already hooked up to the
standard RJ-11 phone jack in the TWC modem, ready to go as soon as the
service is activated.
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:20:19
I am working to reactivate the new phone Modem.
David Reeves: at 1:20:26
The new TWC phone modem also has the upper four LEDs lit solid, with
alternating lit-up lights for the two phone connections.
David Reeves: at 1:20:41
OK, thanks.
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:21:01
You're welcome.
David Reeves: at 1:21:48
BTW, the phone modem did not have a battery as it came in the mail, and
there wasn't any with it in the packaging.
David Reeves: at 1:23:20
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to expect a battery to come in a later shipment
or something, but right now I primarily need to just activate the new modem
so I can at least have basic phone service. (Sorry, not trying to rush you.)
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:23:40
I will help you with the information.
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:23:54
Is this a Vacation home?
David Reeves: at 1:24:28
No, this is my personal residence. I live in a one-bedroom apartment,
high-rise building.
Selwyn Jamison: at 1:24:54
Okay.
David Reeves: at 1:27:03
BTW this is great that your company has support available at this hour of the
night, I've seen a lot of other companies cut-oﬀ after-hours support, so this is
really great.
David Reeves: at 1:28:15
Hi the old modem just power-cycled and is now back on. The new phone
modem didn't apparently do anything. Are you still there? Are we still
connected?
system: at 1:30:19

Hi, I hope you got the news from Leticia Smith the other day
about what has been going on - I'm referring to my close friend
who was recently hospitalized and led to me having to take care
of issues with him and his care on an emergency basis. It looks
like today my friend will be home later although I won't be
around today for our regular appointment as I have to drive out
to the hospital myself to pick him up, possibly sign paperwork
etc., and wrap things up with this issue. As I told Leticia in my
text I sent to her phone early yesterday morning (Dec. 30th) I
have to reschedule for both you and Leticia for sometime next
week. It looks like after this week is over I won't have to deal
with this emergency anymore and the issues tied to it should be
more or less resolved - at least as far as I am personally
concerned - and once next week gets going I can return to a
more normal, routine schedule and get back to handling regular
personal tasks. I should be able to see you and Leticia on the
same regular days next week, same time as well, Wed. and
Thursday. I don't expect any further problems or complications
to come up after this week. I'm guessing you both got the
message, although I have not heard back from Leticia Smith with

any conﬁrmation of any kind of getting any of my messages or
information I have provided on what has been going on. On the
other hand, Leticia did not appear to stop by my apartment the
other day when she would have been scheduled, perhaps she got
the news but did not have time to reply? I did a quick, casual
check of the logs for the buzzer for my door, as well as entry
records for the building for the past few days and it looks like she
never showed up on the property at all yesterday and certainly
didn't come to my apartment - The aparment management
actually has very extensive security which is a bit more than
many common apartment buildings of this size as it is right
across from Great Northen Mall and for a number of years they
have taken many measures to keep the building safe from
downtown riﬀ-raﬀ that take the bus out to the mall and cause
problems, although in the ten years or so I've lived here I haven't
really needed to check into or request details of such records,
but they keep good track of who enters and leaves the building
and when, and I've heard that when the rare occasion something
rare occurs they can come up with information from years back
with all kinds of stuﬀ - long story though, and it really isn't
relevant to this message anyways. I have to go now, I expect to
be back tonight at some point, and until then I will likely be busy
so I might not be able to answer if you call me but I could get
back to you with a message late tonight or tomorrow. Hope to
see you next week, normal time, normal day,

Psychological manipulation
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or perception of
others through abusive, deceptive, or underhanded tactics.[1] By advancing the interests of the manipulator,
often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive.
Social influence is not necessarily negative. For example, doctors can try to convince patients to change
unhealthy habits. The process of manipulation involves bringing an unknowing victim under the domination of
the manipulator, often using deception, and using the victim to serve their own purposes.

Requirements for successful manipulation
According to psychology author George K. Simon, successful psychological manipulation primarily involves
the manipulator:[2]
1. Concealing aggressive intentions and behaviors.
2. Knowing the psychological vulnerabilities of the victim to determine which tactics are likely to be the
most effective.
3. Having a sufficient level of ruthlessness to have no qualms about causing harm to the victim if necessary.
Consequently, the manipulation is likely to be accomplished through covert aggressive (relational aggressive or
passive aggressive) means.[2]

How manipulators control their victims
According to Braiker
Braiker identified the following ways that manipulators control their victims:[1]
Positive reinforcement: includes praise, superficial charm, superficial sympathy (crocodile tears),
excessive apologizing, money, approval, gifts, attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or
smile, and public recognition.
Negative reinforcement: involves removing one from a negative situation as a reward, e.g. "You won't
have to do your homework if you allow me to do this to you."
Intermittent or partial reinforcement: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective
climate of fear and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to
persist - for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose
money overall.
Punishment: includes nagging, yelling, the silent treatment, intimidation, threats, swearing, emotional
blackmail, the guilt trip, sulking, crying, and playing the victim.
Traumatic one-trial learning: using verbal abuse, explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to
establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can condition or train victims to
avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

According to Simon
Simon identified the following manipulative techniques:[2]
Lying: It is hard to tell if somebody is lying at the time they do it, although often the truth may be
apparent later when it is too late. One way to minimize the chances of being lied to is to understand that
some personality types (particularly psychopaths) are experts at the art of lying and cheating, doing it
frequently, and often in subtle ways.
Lying by omission: This is a very subtle form of lying by withholding a significant amount of the truth.
This technique is also used in propaganda.
Denial: Manipulator refuses to admit that he or she has done something wrong.
Rationalization: An excuse made by the manipulator for inappropriate behavior. Rationalization is closely
related to spin.
Minimization: This is a type of denial coupled with rationalization. The manipulator asserts that his or her
behavior is not as harmful or irresponsible as someone else was suggesting, for example, saying that a
taunt or insult was only a joke.
Selective inattention or selective attention: Manipulator refuses to pay attention to anything that may
distract from his or her agenda, saying things like "I don't want to hear it".
Diversion: Manipulator not giving a straight answer to a straight question and instead being diversionary,
steering the conversation onto another topic.
Evasion: Similar to diversion but giving irrelevant, rambling, vague responses, weasel words.
Covert intimidation: Manipulator throwing the victim onto the defensive by using veiled (subtle, indirect
or implied) threats.
Guilt trip: A special kind of intimidation tactic. A manipulator suggests to the conscientious victim that
he or she does not care enough, is too selfish or has it easy. This usually results in the victim feeling bad,
keeping them in a self-doubting, anxious and submissive position.

Shaming: Manipulator uses sarcasm and put-downs to increase fear and self-doubt in the victim.
Manipulators use this tactic to make others feel unworthy and therefore defer to them. Shaming tactics
can be very subtle such as a fierce look or glance, unpleasant tone of voice, rhetorical comments, subtle
sarcasm. Manipulators can make one feel ashamed for even daring to challenge them. It is an effective
way to foster a sense of inadequacy in the victim.
Playing the victim role: Manipulator portrays him- or herself as a victim of circumstance or of someone
else's behavior in order to gain pity, sympathy or evoke compassion and thereby get something from
another. Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering and the manipulator often
finds it easy to play on sympathy to get cooperation.
Vilifying the victim: More than any other, this tactic is a powerful means of putting the victim on the
defensive while simultaneously masking the aggressive intent of the manipulator, while the manipulator
falsely accuses the victim as being an abuser in response when the victim stands up for or defends
themselves or their position.
Playing the servant role: Cloaking a self-serving agenda in guise of a service to a more noble cause, for
example saying he is acting in a certain way to be "obedient" to or in "service" to an authority figure or
"just doing their job".
Seduction: Manipulator uses charm, praise, flattery or overtly supporting others in order to get them to
lower their defenses and give their trust and loyalty to him or her. They will also offer help with the intent
to gain trust and access to an unsuspecting victim they have charmed.
Projecting the blame (blaming others): Manipulator scapegoats in often subtle, hard-to-detect ways.
Often, the manipulator will project his/her own psychotic thinking onto the victim, making the victim
look like he/she has done something wrong. Manipulators will also claim that the victim is the one who is
at fault for believing lies that they were conned into believing, as if the victim forced the manipulator to
be deceitful. All blame, except for the part that is used by the manipulator to accept false guilt, is done in
order to make the victim feel guilty about making healthy choices, correct thinking and good behaviors. It
is frequently used as a means of psychological and emotional manipulation and control. Manipulators lie
about lying, only to re-manipulate the original, less believable story into a "more acceptable" truth that
the victim will believe. Projecting lies as being the truth is another common method of control and
manipulation. Manipulators love to falsely accuse the victim as "deserving to be treated that way." They
often claim that the victim is crazy and/or abusive, especially when there is evidence against the
manipulator. (See Feigning, below.)
Feigning innocence: Manipulator tries to suggest that any harm done was unintentional or that they did
not do something that they were accused of. Manipulator may put on a look of surprise or indignation.
This tactic makes the victim question his or her own judgment and possibly his own sanity.
Feigning confusion: Manipulator tries to play dumb by pretending he or she does not know what the
victim is talking about or is confused about an important issue brought to his or her attention. The
manipulator intentionally confuses the victim in order for the victim to doubt his/her own accuracy of
perception, often pointing out key elements that the manipulator intentionally included in case there is
room for doubt. Sometimes manipulators will have used cohorts in advance to help back up their story.
Brandishing anger: Manipulator uses anger to brandish sufficient emotional intensity and rage to shock
the victim into submission. The manipulator is not actually angry, he or she just puts on an act. He just
wants what he wants and gets "angry" when denied. Controlled anger is often used as a manipulation
tactic to avoid confrontation, avoid telling the truth or to further hide intent. There are often threats used
by the manipulator of going to police, or falsely reporting abuses that the manipulator intentionally
contrived to scare or intimidate the victim into submission. Blackmail and other threats of exposure are
other forms of controlled anger and manipulation, especially when the victim refuses initial requests or
suggestions by the manipulator. Anger is also used as a defense so the manipulator can avoid telling
truths at inconvenient times or circumstances. Anger is often used as a tool or defense to ward off
11/30/2016 7:15 PM

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation

inquiries or suspicion. The victim becomes more focused on the anger instead of the manipulation tactic.
Bandwagon Effect: Manipulator comforts the victim into submission by claiming (whether true or false)
that many people already have done something, and the victim should as well. These include phrases such
as "Many people like you ..." or "Everyone does this anyways." Such manipulation can be seen in peer
pressure situations, often occurring in scenarios where the manipulator attempts to influence the victim
into trying drugs or other substances.

Vulnerabilities exploited by manipulators
According to Braiker's self-help book,[1] manipulators exploit the following vulnerabilities (buttons) that may
exist in victims:
the "disease to please"
addiction to earning the approval and acceptance of others
Emotophobia (fear of negative emotion; i.e. a fear of expressing anger, frustration or disapproval)
lack of assertiveness and ability to say no
blurry sense of identity (with soft personal boundaries)
low self-reliance
external locus of control
According to Simon,[2] manipulators exploit the following vulnerabilities that may exist in victims:
naïveté - victim finds it too hard to accept the idea that some people are cunning, devious and ruthless or
is "in denial" if he or she is being victimized.
over-conscientiousness - victim is too willing to give manipulator the benefit of the doubt and see their
side of things in which they blame the victim.
low self-confidence - victim is self-doubting, lacking in confidence and assertiveness, likely to go on the
defensive too easily.
over-intellectualization - victim tries too hard to understand and believes the manipulator has some
understandable reason to be hurtful.
emotional dependency - victim has a submissive or dependent personality. The more emotionally
dependent the victim is, the more vulnerable he or she is to being exploited and manipulated.
Manipulators generally take the time to scope out the characteristics and vulnerabilities of their victim.
Kantor advises in his book,[3] the following are vulnerable to psychopathic manipulators involve being too:
dependent - dependent people need to be loved and are therefore gullible and liable to say yes to
something to which they should say no.
immature - has impaired judgment and believes the exaggerated advertising claims.
naïve - cannot believe there are dishonest people in the world, taking for granted that if there were they
would not be allowed to operate.
impressionable - overly seduced by charmers. For example, they might vote for the seemingly charming
politician who kisses babies.
trusting - people who are honest often assume that everyone else is honest. They are more likely to
commit themselves to people they hardly know without checking credentials, etc., and less likely to
question so-called experts.
lonely - lonely people may accept any offer of human contact. A psychopathic stranger may offer human

companionship for a price.
narcissistic - narcissists are prone to falling for unmerited flattery.
impulsive - make snap decisions about, for example, what to buy or whom to marry without consulting
others.
altruistic - the opposite of psychopathic: too honest, too fair, too empathetic.
frugal - cannot say no to a bargain even if they know the reason it is so cheap.
materialistic - easy prey for loan sharks or get-rich-quick schemes.
greedy - the greedy and dishonest may fall prey to a psychopath who can easily entice them to act in an
immoral way.
masochistic - lack self-respect and so unconsciously let psychopaths take advantage of them. They think
they deserve it out of a sense of guilt.
the elderly - the elderly can become fatigued and less capable of multi-tasking. When hearing a sales
pitch they are less likely to consider that it could be a con. They are prone to giving money to someone
with a hard-luck story. See elder abuse.

Motivations of manipulators
Manipulators can have various possible motivations, including but not limited to:[1]
the need to advance their own purposes and personal gain at virtually any cost to others
a strong need to attain feelings of power and superiority in relationships with others
a want and need to feel in control (aka. control freak)
a desire to gain a feeling of power over others in order to raise their perception of self-esteem
boredom, or growing tired of his/her surroundings, seeing it as a game more than hurting others
covert agenda, criminal or otherwise, including financial manipulation (often seen when the elderly or
unsuspecting, unprotected wealthy are intentionally targeted for the sole purpose of obtaining a victim's
financial assets)

Psychopathy
Being manipulative is in Factor 1 of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL).[4]

In the workplace
The workplace psychopath may often rapidly shift between emotions – used to manipulate people or cause high
anxiety.[5]
The authors of the book Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work describe a five phase model of how a
typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power. In phase three (manipulation) - the psychopath
will create a scenario of "psychopathic fiction" where positive information about themselves and negative
disinformation about others will be created, where your role as a part of a network of pawns or patrons will be
utilised and you will be groomed into accepting the psychopath's agenda.[6]

Antisocial, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders
According to Kernberg, antisocial, borderline, and narcissistic personality disorders are all organized at a

11/30/2016 7:15 PM

Psychological manipulation - Wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation

borderline level of personality organization,[7] and the three share some common characterological deficits and
overlapping personality traits, with deceitfulness and exceptional manipulative abilities being the most common
traits among the three. Sociopaths, borderlines, and narcissists are often both physically attractive (narcissists
and borderlines in particular) and highly intelligent and can be efficient, persuasive, and incredible liars.[7]
Other shared traits include pathological narcissism,[7] consistent irresponsibility, machiavellianism, lack of
empathy,[8] cruelty, meanness, impulsivity, proneness to self-harm and addictions,[9] interpersonal exploitation,
hostility, anger and rage, vanity, emotional instability, rejection sensitivity, perfectionism, and the use of
primitive defence mechanisms that are pathological and narcissistic. Common narcissistic defences include
splitting, denial, projection, projective identification, primitive idealization and devaluation, distortion
(including exaggeration, minimization and lies), and omnipotence.[10]
Psychologist Marsha M. Linehan has stated that people with borderline personality disorder often exhibit
behaviors which are not truly manipulative, but are erroneously interpreted as such.[11] According to her, these
behaviors often appear as unthinking manifestations of intense pain, and are often not deliberate as to be
considered truly manipulative. In the DSM-V, manipulation was removed as a defining characteristic of
borderline personality disorder.
Manipulative behavior is also common to narcissists, who use manipulation to obtain power and narcissistic
supply. Those with antisocial personalities will manipulate for material items, power, and a wide variety of
other reasons.[12]

Histrionic personality disorder
People with histrionic personality disorder are usually high-functioning, both socially and professionally. They
usually have good social skills, despite tending to use them to manipulate others into making them the center of
attention.[13]

Machiavellianism
Machiavellianism is a term that some social and personality psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to
be unemotional, and therefore able to detach him or herself from conventional morality and hence to deceive
and manipulate others. In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis developed a test for measuring a
person's level of Machiavellianism (sometimes referred to as the Machiavelli test).[14]

In popular culture
In the TV series Minder, Terry McCann is employed as Arthur Daley's minder on vague and ungenerous
terms, with it often being hinted that Arthur has manipulated him into this job, and indeed is seen to
continue to manipulate Terry throughout the character's run in the series, despite his often attempting to
find other means of employment and break free from Arthur's control.
In the acclaimed TV series House, the titular character is described as very Machiavellian, often
psychologically manipulating his patients through lying and deception in order to better their health.
In the Nintendo 3DS game Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney − Dual Destinies, the rival prosecutor Simon
Blackquill is a master of psychological manipulation as well as mind games, using both tactics to keep
witnesses, the defense attorneys, and the judge all on their toes and going along with his twisted logic.
In the Pretty Little Liars, Alison DiLaurentis has a personality of Psychological manipulative.

Dark triad
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The dark triad is a subject in psychology that focuses on three personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism,
and psychopathy.[1][2][3][4] Use of the term "dark" implies that people possessing these traits have malevolent
qualities.[5][6][7][8]
Research on the dark triad is used in applied psychology, especially within the fields of law enforcement,
clinical psychology and business management. People scoring high on these traits are more likely to commit
crimes, cause social distress and create severe problems for an organization, especially if they are in leadership
positions (for more information, see psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism in the workplace).
All three dark triad traits are conceptually distinct although empirical evidence shows them to be overlapping.
They are associated with a callous-manipulative interpersonal style.[9]
Narcissism is characterized by grandiosity, pride, egotism, and a lack of empathy.[10]
Machiavellianism is characterized by manipulation and exploitation of others, a cynical disregard for
morality, and a focus on self-interest and deception.[11]
Psychopathy is characterized by enduring antisocial behavior, impulsivity, selfishness, callousness, and
remorselessness.[12]
A factor analysis carried out at the Glasgow Caledonian University found that among the big five personality
traits, low agreeableness is the strongest correlate of the dark triad, while neuroticism and a lack of
conscientiousness were associated with some of the dark triad members.[11]

History
In 1998, McHoskey, Worzel, and Szyarto[13] provoked a controversy by claiming that narcissism,
Machiavellianism, and psychopathy are more or less interchangeable in normal samples. Delroy L. Paulhus and
McHoskey debated these perspectives at a subsequent American Psychological Association (APA) conference,
inspiring a body of research that continues to grow in the published literature. Paulhus and Williams found
enough behavioral, personality, and cognitive differences between the traits to suggest that they were distinct
constructs; however, they concluded that further research was needed to elucidate how and why they overlap.[1]

Origins
The long-debated "nature versus nurture" issue has been applied to the dark triad. Research has begun to
investigate the origins of the dark triad traits. In a similar manner to research on the Big Five, empirical studies
have been conducted in an effort to understand the relative contributions of biology (nature) and environmental
factors (nurture) in the development of dark triad traits.
One of the ways in which researchers attempt to dissect the relative influence of genetic and environmental
factors on personality (and individual differences more generally) is a broad investigative technique loosely
grouped under the heading of "twin studies". For example, in one approach to twin studies,[14][15][16]
researchers compare the personality scores of monozygotic (MZ) or identical twins reared together to dizygotic
(DZ) or fraternal twins reared together. Because both types of twins in this design are reared together, all twin
pairs are regarded as having shared a 100% common environment. In contrast, the monozygotic twins share
100% of their genes whereas the dizygotic twins only share about 50% of their genes. Therefore, for any given
personality trait, it is possible to parcell out genetic influences by first obtaining the MZ correlation (reflecting
100% common environment and 100% shared genes) and subtracting the DZ correlation (reflecting 100%
common environment and 50% shared genes). This difference represents 50% of the genetic influence; doubled,
this number is said to account for 100% of the genetic influence, and is one way to derive an index of
heritability (sometimes called the heritability coefficient and represented as h2). Similarly, MZ - h2 may be
regarded as an estimate of the influence of the common environment. Finally, because individual differences
and the environment are supposed to account for the totality of behavior, it is said that subtracting the sum of h2
and the common environment influence from 1 is equal to the influence of unique or non-shared environments.

Biological
All three traits of the dark triad have been found to have substantial genetic components.[17] It has also been
found that the observed relationships among the dark triad, and among the dark triad and the Big Five, are
strongly driven by individual differences in genes.[18] However, while psychopathy (h2 = .64) and narcissism
(h2 = .59) both have a relatively large heritable component, Machiavellianism (h2 = .31) has been found to be

11/30/2016 7:05 PM

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad

less heritable.[18][19]

Environmental
Compared to biological factors, the influence of environmental factors seem to be more subtle and account for
less—yet still significant—variation in individual differences as related to the development of dark triad
traits.[18] The influence of non-shared or unique environmental factors (definition and mathematical derivation
included above at the end of the "Origins" subsection) accounts for a significant amount of the variance in all 3
dark triad traits (narcissism = .41, Machiavellianism = .30, psychopathy = .32), whereas only Machiavellianism
(r = .39) has been found to be significantly related to a shared environmental factor.[20] Although it requires
substantiation, some researchers have interpreted this latter finding (along with the comparatively lower
heritability noted in the section above) to mean that Machiavellianism is the most likely dark triad trait to be
influenced by experience.[21] At the very least, this notion about the modifiability of Machiavellianism does
make some sense insofar as that the less variance there is attributable to genetic factors, the more variance there
must be attributable to other factors, and "other" factors have traditionally be synopsized as environmental or
experiential in nature.

Evolutionary
A third theory that has been referred to as instrumental in the development of dark triad traits, and which can be
seen to influence both biological and environmental factors, is evolutionary theory. It has been argued that
evolutionary behavior predicts not only the development of dark triad personalities, but also the flourishing of
such personalities.[22] Indeed, it has been found that individuals demonstrating dark triad personality can be
highly successful in society.[18] However, this success is typically short-lived.[18] The main evolutionary
argument behind the dark triad traits emphasizes mating strategies.[23][24] This argument focuses on the notion
of life history strategy.[25] Life history strategy proposes that individuals differ in reproductive strategies; an
emphasis on mating is termed a “fast life” strategy, while an emphasis on parenting is termed a “slow
reproductive” strategy.[25] There is some evidence[26][27] that the dark triad traits are related to fast life history
strategies, however, there have been some mixed results, and not all three dark triad traits have been related to
this strategy. A more detailed approach[28] has attempted to account for some of these mixed results by
analyzing the traits at a finer level of detail. These researchers found that while some components of the dark
triad are related to a fast life strategy, other components are related to slow reproductive strategies.[29]

Sub-clinical dimensions vs. disorders
In general, clinicians treat these traits as pathological, something that needs to be treated, and inherently
undesirable, e.g. socially condemned or personally counter-productive. However, others argue that adaptive
qualities may accompany the maladaptive ones. The evolutionary perspective (above) considers the dark triad to
represent different mating strategies. Their frequency in the gene pool requires at least some local adaptation.
The everyday versions of these traits appear in student and community samples, where even high levels can be
observed among individuals who manage to get along in daily life. Even in these samples, research indicates
correlations with aggression,[30] racism,[31] and bullying[32] among other forms of social aversiveness.
Narcissism was discussed in the writings of Sigmund Freud, and psychopathy as a clinical diagnosis was
addressed in the early writings of Hervey Cleckley in 1941 with the publication of The Mask of Sanity.[33]
Given the dimensional model of narcissism and psychopathy, complemented by self-report assessments that are

11/30/2016 7:05 PM

Dark triad - Wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad

appropriate for the general population, these traits can now be studied at the subclinical level.[34] In the general
population, the prevalence rates for sub-clinical and clinical psychopathy are estimated at around 1% and 0.2%,
respectively.[35][36][37] Unfortunately, there do not seem to be any reliable estimates of either clinical or
sub-clinical narcissism in the general population.[38]
With respect to empirical research, psychopathy was not formally studied until the 1970s with the pioneering
efforts of Robert Hare, his Psychopathy Checklist (PCL), and its revision (PCL-R).[39] Hare notes in his book,
Without Conscience[40] that asking psychopaths to self-report on psychologically important matters does not
necessarily provide accurate or unbiased data. However, recent efforts have been made to study psychopathy in
the dimensional realm using self-reported instruments, as with the Levenson Primary and Secondary
Psychopathy Scales,[41] The Psychopathic Personality Inventory,[42] and the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale.[43]
Similarly, assessment of narcissism required clinical interviews, until the popular "Narcissistic Personality
Inventory" was created by Raskin and Hall in 1979.[44] Since the NPI, several other measures have emerged
which attempt to provide self-report alternatives for personality disorder assessment.[45] In addition, new
instruments have been developed to study "pathological" narcissism[46] as opposed to "grandiose" narcissism,
which is what many argue the NPI measures.[47][48]
Machiavellianism has never been referenced in any version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM) for psychological disorders. It has been treated as strictly a personality construct. The original
published version of the Mach-IV[49] is still the most widely used in empirical research.[50]

Components
As noted previously, there is a good deal of conceptual and empirical overlap between the dark triad traits. For
example, researchers have noted that all three traits share characteristics such as a lack of empathy,[21]
interpersonal hostility,[51] and interpersonal offensiveness.[52] Likely due in part to this overlap, a number of
measures have recently been developed that attempt to measure all three dark triad traits simultaneously, such as
the Dirty Dozen[53] and the short dark triad (SD3).[54]
At their root, however, most of these measures are questionnaire-style and require either self-response or
observer-response (e.g., ratings from supervisors or coworkers). Both methods can prove problematic when
attempting to measure any socially aversive trait as self-responders may be motivated to deceive.[55] A more
specific confound might also exist for dark triad traits and Machiavellianism in particular: individuals who are
skilled at deceiving and manipulating others should be perceived as low in deceptiveness and manipulation by
others, and are therefore likely to receive inaccurate ratings.[56]
Despite these criticisms and the acknowledged commonalities among the dark triad traits, there is evidence that
the constructs are related yet distinct.

Machiavellianism
Named after the philosophy espoused by Niccolò Machiavelli in The Prince, people who score high on this trait
are cynical (in an amoral self-interest sense, not in a doubtful or skeptical sense), unprincipled, believe in
interpersonal manipulation as the key for life success, and behave accordingly.[18] Scores on measures of
Machiavellianism correlate negatively with agreeableness (r= -.47) and conscientiousness (r=-.34).[57]
Machiavellianism is also significantly correlated with psychopathy.[58]
11/30/2016 7:05 PM

Narcissism
Individuals who score high on narcissism display grandiosity, entitlement, dominance, and superiority.[59]
Narcissism has been found to correlate positively with extraversion (r = .42) and openness (r = .38) and
negatively with agreeableness (r = -.36).[60] Narcissism has also been found to have a significant correlation
with psychopathy.[61]

Psychopathy
Considered the most malevolent of the dark triad,[62] individuals who score high on psychopathy show low
levels of empathy combined with high levels of impulsivity and thrill-seeking.[63] The similarity between
psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder have been noted by some researchers.[18] Psychopathy has been
found to correlate with all of the Big Five personality factors: extraversion (r = .34), agreeableness (r = -.25),
conscientiousness (r = -.24), neuroticism (r = -.34) and openness (r = .24).[64]

Group differences
The most pronounced group difference is in gender: numerous studies have shown that men tend to score higher
than women on narcissism,[65] Machiavellianism,[66][67][68] and psychopathy,[41][42][69][70] although the
magnitude of the difference varies across traits and the measurement instruments used. One interesting finding
related to narcissism—albeit one based on non-representative samples—is that while men continue to score
higher than women, it seems that the gender gap has shrunk considerably when comparing cohort data from
1992 and 2006. More specifically, the aforementioned findings indicate that there has been a general increase in
levels of narcissism over time among college students of both sexes, but comparatively, the average level of
narcissism in women has increased more than the average level of narcissism in men.[71]
There is far less information available on race differences in dark triad traits, and the data that is available is not
representative of the population at-large. For instance, a 2008 research study using undergraduate participants
found that Caucasians reported higher levels of narcissism relative to Asians.[72][73] Similarly, another 2008
study using undergraduate participants found that Caucasians tended to score slightly higher than
non-Caucasians on Machiavellianism.[74] When attempting to discern whether there are ethnic differences in
psychopathy, researchers have addressed the issue using different measurement instruments (e.g., the
Self-Report Psychopathy Scale and The Psychopathic Personality Inventory), but no race differences have been
found regardless of the measure used.[75][76] Additionally, when comparing Caucasians and African Americans
from correctional, substance abuse, and psychiatric samples—groups with typically high prevalence rates of
psychopathy—researchers again failed to find any meaningful group differences in psychopathy.[77] In
summary, there is some sparse evidence that Caucasians tend to score higher on measures of narcissism and
Machiavellianism than other ethnicities, while no evidence exists for race differences in psychopathy.
The focal variable when analyzing generational or cohort differences in dark triad traits has tended to be
narcissism, arising from the hypothesis that so-called “Generation Me” or “Generation Entitlement” would
exhibit higher levels of narcissism than previous generations. Indeed, based on analyses of responses to the
Narcissistic Personality Inventory collected from over 16,000 U.S. undergraduate students between 1979 and
2006, it was concluded that average levels of narcissism had increased over time.[78] Similar results were
obtained in a follow-up study that analyzed the changes within each college campus.[79] Trzesniewski &
Donnellan (2010)[80] present conflicting evidence and argue that there have not been large changes in
disposition or behavioral strategies across generations, although they do note that the current generation is less

trusting and more cynical, which are both changes that might be indicative of an increase in Machiavellianism.

Perspectives
In the workplace
Oliver James identifies each of the three dark triadic personality traits as typically being prevalent in the
workplace (see also Machiavellianism in the workplace, narcissism in the workplace and psychopathy in the
workplace).[81] Furnham[82] (2010) has identified that the dark triad is related to the acquisition of leadership
positions and interpersonal influence. In a meta-analysis of dark triad and workplace outcomes, Jonason and
colleagues (2012) found that each of the dark triad traits were related to manipulation in the workplace, but each
via unique mechanisms. Specifically, Machiavellianism was related with the use of excessive charm in
manipulation, narcissism was related with the use of physical appearance, and psychopathy was related with
physical threats.[83] Jonason and colleagues also found that the dark triad traits fully mediated the relationship
between gender and workplace manipulation. The dark triad traits have also been found to be fairly
well-represented in upper-level management and CEOs.[84]

Internet trolls
Recent studies have found that people who are identified as trolls tend to have dark personality traits and show
signs of sadism, antisocial behavior, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism.[85][86][87] The 2013 case study
suggested that there are a number of similarities between anti-social and flame trolling activities and the 2014
survey indicated that trolling is an Internet manifestation of everyday sadism. Both studies suggest that this
trolling may be linked to bullying in both adolescents and adults.

As a mating strategy
Studies have suggested that on average, those who exhibit the dark triad of personality traits have an accelerated
mating strategy, reporting more sex partners, more favorable attitudes towards casual sex,[88] lowered standards
in their short-term mates,[89] a tendency to steal or poach mates from others,[90] more risk-taking in the form of
substance abuse,[91] a tendency to prefer immediate but smaller amounts of money over delayed but larger
amounts of money,[92] limited self-control and greater incidence of ADHD symptoms[93] and a pragmatic and
game-playing love style.[94] These traits have been identified as part of a fast life strategy that appears to be
enacted by an exploitative, opportunistic, and protean approach to life in general[95] and at work.[96]
The evidence is mixed regarding the exact link between the dark triad and reproductive success. For example,
there is a lack of empirical evidence for reproductive success in the case of psychopathy.[12] Additionally, these
traits are not universally short-term-oriented[97] nor are they all impulsive.[98] Furthermore, much of the
research reported pertaining to the dark triad cited in the above paragraph is based on statistical procedures that
assume the dark triad are a single construct, in spite of genetic[99] and meta-analytic evidence to the
contrary.[100]

Appearance
Several academic studies have found evidence that people with dark triad personalities are judged as slightly
better-looking than average on first sight.[101] Two studies have determined that this is because people with dark

triad traits put more effort into their appearance, and the difference in attractiveness disappears when "dressed
down" with bland clothing and without make up.[102][103] Two more studies found that only narcissistic subjects
were judged to be better-looking, but the other dark triad traits of machiavellianism and psychopathy had no
correlation with looks.[104][105]

Related concepts
Big Five
The five factor model of personality has significant relationships with the dark triad combined and with each of
the dark triad’s traits. The dark triad overall is negatively related to both agreeableness and
conscientiousness.[106] More specifically, Machiavellianism captures a suspicious versus trusting view of
human nature which is also captured by the Trust sub-scale on the agreeableness trait.[107] Extroversion
captures similar aspects of assertiveness, dominance, and self-importance as narcissism.[107] Narcissism also is
positively related to the achievement striving and competence aspects of Conscientiousness. Psychopathy has
the strongest correlations with low dutifulness and deliberation aspects of Conscientiousness.[106]

Honesty-humility
The honesty-humility factor from the HEXACO model of personality is used to measure sincerity, fairness,
greed avoidance, and modesty. Honesty-Humility contrasts antisocial behavior at the low end of the trait with
pro-social behavior at the high end which strongly theoretically links it to the dark triad traits.[108] Likewise, all
three dark triad traits are strongly negatively correlated with Honesty-Humility.[106] The conceptual overlap of
the three traits which represents a tendency to manipulate and exploit others for personal gain defines the
negative pole of the honesty-humility factor.[109] · Typically, any positive effects from the DT and low H-H
occur at the individual level, that is, any benefits are conferred onto the beholder of the traits (e.g., successful
mating, obtainment of leadership positions) and not onto others or society at large. However, one positive
outcome of low H-H, that while still providing benefits to the individual, also indirectly benefits society, is that
of creativity. A study by Silvia and colleagues (2011) found that individuals who score low in Honesty-Humility
have higher levels of creativity.[110]

Dark tetrad
Several researchers have suggested expanding the dark triad to contain a fourth dark trait. Everyday sadism,
defined as the enjoyment of cruelty, is the most common addition. While sadism is highly correlated with the
dark triad, researchers have shown that sadism predicts anti-social behavior beyond the dark triad.[111][112]
Borderline personality disorder and status-driven risk-taking have also been proposed as additions.[106]

Vulnerable dark triad
The vulnerable dark triad (VDT) comprises three related and similar constructs: vulnerable narcissism, factor 2
psychopathy, and borderline personality disorder. A study found that these three constructs are significantly
related to one another, and manifest similar nomological networks. Although the VDT members are related to
negative emotionality and antagonistic interpersonal styles, they are also related to introversion and
disinhibition.[113]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Machiavellianism is "the employment of cunning and duplicity in
statecraft or in general conduct".[1] The word comes from the Italian
Renaissance diplomat and writer Niccolò Machiavelli, born in 1469,
who wrote Il Principe (The Prince), among other works.
In modern psychology, Machiavellianism is one of the dark triad
personalities, characterized by a duplicitous interpersonal style, a
cynical disregard for morality and a focus on self-interest and personal
gain.[2]

Niccolò Machiavelli

Political thought
In the 16th century, immediately following the publication of The Prince, Machiavellianism was seen as a
foreign plague infecting northern European politics, originating in Italy, and having first infected France. It was
in this context that the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572 in Paris came to be seen as a product of
Machiavellianism, a view greatly influenced by the Huguenot Innocent Gentillet, who published his Discours
contre Machievel in 1576, which was printed in ten editions in three languages over the next four years.[3]
Gentillet held, quite wrongly according to Sydney Anglo, that Machiavelli's "books [were] held most dear and
precious by our Italian and Italionized [sic] courtiers" in France (in the words of his first English translation),
and so (in Anglo's paraphrase) "at the root of France's present degradation, which has culminated not only in the
St Bartholemew massacre but the glee of its perverted admirers".[4] In fact there is little trace of Machiavelli in
French writings before the massacre, not that politicians telegraph their intentions in writing, until Gentillet's
own book, but this concept was seized upon by many contemporaries, and played a crucial part in setting the
long-lasting popular concept of Machiavellianism.[5]
The English playwrights William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe were enthusiastic proponents of this
view. Shakespeare's Gloucester, later Richard III, refers to Machiavelli in Henry VI, Part III, for instance:

I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
In The Jew of Malta (1589–90) "Machievel" in person speaks the Prologue, claiming not to be dead, but to have
possessed the soul of (the Duke of) Guise, "And, now the Guise is dead, is come from France/ To view this
land, and frolic with his friends" (Prologue, lines 3–4)[6] Marlowe's last play, The Massacre at Paris (1593)
takes the massacre, and the following years, as its subject, with the Duke of Guise and Catherine de' Medici
both depicted as Machiavellian plotters, bent on evil from the start.
The Anti-Machiavel is an 18th-century essay by Frederick the Great, King of Prussia and patron of Voltaire,
rebutting The Prince, and Machiavellianism. It was first published in September 1740, a few months after
Frederick became king, and is one of many such works.
Denis Diderot, the French philosopher, viewed Machiavellianism as "an abhorrent type of politics" and the "art
of tyranny".[7]

Psychology
Machiavellianism is also a term that some social and personality psychologists use to describe a person's
tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach him or herself from conventional morality and hence
to deceive and manipulate others. In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis developed a test for
measuring a person's level of Machiavellianism (sometimes referred to as the Machiavelli test).[8] Their
Mach - IV test, a twenty-statement personality survey, became the standard self-assessment tool of
Machiavellianism. People scoring high on the scale (high Machs) tend to endorse statements such as, "Never
tell anyone the real reason you did something unless it is useful to do so," (No. 1) but not ones like, "Most
people are basically good and kind" (No. 4), "There is no excuse for lying to someone else," (No. 7) or "Most
people who get ahead in the world lead clean, moral lives" (No. 11). Using their scale, Christie and Geis
conducted multiple experimental tests that showed that the interpersonal strategies and behavior of "High
Machs" and "Low Machs" differ.[9] Their basic results have been widely replicated.[10] Measured on the
Mach - IV scale, males are, on average, slightly more Machiavellian than females.[9][11]

Motivation
A 1992 review described Machiavellian motivation as related to cold selfishness and pure instrumentality, and
those high on the trait were assumed to pursue their motives (e.g. sex, achievement, sociality) in duplicitous
ways. More recent research on the motivations of high Machs compared to low Machs found that they gave
high priority to money, power, and competition and relatively low priority to community building, self-love, and
family concerns. High Machs admitted to focusing on unmitigated achievement and winning at any cost.[2]

Abilities
Due to their skill at interpersonal manipulation, there has often been an assumption that high Machs possess
superior intelligence, or ability to understand other people in social situations. However, research has firmly
established that Machiavellianism is unrelated to IQ. Furthermore, studies on emotional intelligence have found
that high Machiavellianism actually tends to be associated with low emotional intelligence as assessed by both
performance and questionnaire measures. Both empathy and emotion recognition have been shown to have
11/30/2016 7:06 PM

Machiavellianism - Wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellianism

negative correlations with Machiavellianism. Additionally, research has shown that Machiavellianism is
unrelated to a more advanced theory of mind, that is, the ability to anticipate what others are thinking in social
situations. If high Machs actually are skilled at manipulating others this appears to be unrelated to any special
cognitive abilities as such.[2]

Relations with other personality traits
Machiavellianism is one of the three personality traits referred to as the dark triad, along with narcissism and
psychopathy. Some psychologists consider Machiavellianism to be essentially a subclinical form of
psychopathy,[12] although recent research suggests that while Machiavellianism and psychopathy overlap, they
are distinct personality constructs.[2][13] Machiavellianism has been found to be negatively correlated with
Agreeableness (r = -0.47) and Conscientiousness (r = -0.34), two dimensions of the Big Five personality model
(NEO-PI-R).[13] However, Machiavellianism correlates more highly with the Honesty-humility dimension of
the six-factor HEXACO model than with any of the Big Five dimensions.[2] Machiavellianism has also been
located within the interpersonal circumplex, which consists of the two independent dimensions of agency and
communion. Agency refers to motivation to succeed and to individuate the self, whereas communion refers to
motivation to merge with others and to support group interests. Machiavellianism lies in the quadrant of the
circumplex defined by high agency and low communion.[2] Machiavellianism has been found to lie diagonally
opposite from a circumplex construct called self-construal, a tendency to prefer communion over agency. This
suggests that people high in Machiavellianism do not simply wish to achieve, they wish to do so at the expense
of (or at least without regard to) others.[2]

Game theory
In 2002, the Machiavellianism scale of Christie and Geis was applied by behavioral game theorists Anna
Gunnthorsdottir, Kevin McCabe and Vernon L. Smith[11] in their search for explanations for the spread of
observed behavior in experimental games, in particular individual choices which do not correspond to
assumptions of material self-interest captured by the standard Nash equilibrium prediction. It was found that in
a trust game, those with high MACH-IV scores tended to follow homo economicus' equilibrium strategies while
those with low MACH-IV scores tended to deviate from the equilibrium, and instead made choices that
reflected widely accepted moral standards and social preferences.

In the workplace
Machiavellianism in the workplace is the employment of cunning and duplicity in a business setting. It is an
increasingly studied phenomenon. The root of the concept of Machiavellianism is the book The Prince by
Machiavelli which lays out advice to rulers how to govern their subjects. Machiavellianism has been studied
extensively over the past 40 years as a personality characteristic that shares features with manipulative
leadership tactics. It has in recent times been adapted and applied to the context of the workplace and
organizations by many writers and academics. The Machiavellian typically only manipulates on occasions
where it is necessary to achieve the required objectives.[14]
Oliver James identifies Machiavellianism as one of the dark triadic personality traits in the workplace, the
others being narcissism and psychopathy.[15]
A new model of Machiavellianism based in organizational settings consists of three factors:[14]

Narcissism
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Narcissism is the pursuit of gratification from vanity or egotistic
admiration of one's own attributes. The term originated from Greek
mythology, where the young Narcissus fell in love with his own image
reflected in a pool of water. Narcissism is a concept in psychoanalytic
theory, which was popularly introduced in Sigmund Freud's essay On
Narcissism (1914). The American Psychiatric Association has had the
classification narcissistic personality disorder in its Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) since 1968, drawing on
the historical concept of megalomania.
Narcissism is also considered a social or cultural problem. It is a factor
in trait theory used in various self-report inventories of personality[1]
such as the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory. It is one of the three
dark triadic personality traits (the others being psychopathy and
Machiavellianism). Except in the sense of primary narcissism or healthy
self-love, narcissism is usually considered a problem in a person's or
group's relationships with self and others. Narcissism is not the same as
egocentrism.

History
The term "narcissism" comes from the Greek myth about Narcissus (Greek:
Νάρκισσος, Narkissos), a handsome Greek youth who, according to Ovid,
rejected the desperate advances of the nymph Echo. These advances
eventually led Narcissus to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of
water. Unable to consummate his love, Narcissus "lay gazing enraptured
into the pool, hour after hour," and finally changed into a flower that bears
his name, the narcissus.[2] The concept of excessive selfishness has been
recognized throughout history. In ancient Greece the concept was
understood as hubris. It is only more recently that narcissism has been
defined in psychological terms.
In 1752 Jean-Jacques Rousseau's play Narcissus: or the Self-Admirer
was performed in Paris.
In 1898 Havelock Ellis, an English psychologist, used the term
"Narcissus-like" in reference to excessive masturbation, whereby the
person becomes his or her own sex object[3]
In 1899, Paul Näcke was the first person to use the term "narcissism"
in a study of sexual perversions.
Otto Rank in 1911 published the first psychoanalytical paper
specifically concerned with narcissism, linking it to vanity and
self-admiration.[3]

The myth of Sisyphus tells about
a man who pushes his stone up a
mountain each day, only to have

Sigmund Freud published a paper on narcissism in 1914 called "On Narcissism: An Introduction".[4]
In 1923, Martin Buber published an essay "Ich und Du" (I and You), in which he pointed out that our
narcissism often leads us to relate to others as objects instead of as equals.

Traits and signs
Four dimensions
of narcissism as a
personality
variable have been
delineated:

Life is a stage, and when the curtain falls upon an act, it is finished and forgotten. The emptiness of
such a life is beyond imagination.
—Alexander Lowen describing the existence of a narcissist[5]

leadership/authority, superiority/arrogance, self-absorption/self-admiration, and exploitativeness/entitlement.[6]
A 2012 book on power-hungry narcissists suggests that narcissists typically display most, and sometimes all, of
the following traits:[7]
An obvious self-focus in interpersonal exchanges
Problems in sustaining satisfying relationships
A lack of psychological awareness (see insight in psychology and psychiatry, egosyntonic)
Difficulty with empathy
Problems distinguishing the self from others (see narcissism and boundaries)
Hypersensitivity to any insults or imagined insults (see criticism and narcissists, narcissistic rage and
narcissistic injury)
Vulnerability to shame rather than guilt
Haughty body language
Flattery towards people who admire and affirm them (narcissistic supply)
Detesting those who do not admire them (narcissistic abuse)
Using other people without considering the cost of doing so
Pretending to be more important than they actually are
Bragging (subtly but persistently) and exaggerating their achievements
Claiming to be an "expert" at many things
Inability to view the world from the perspective of other people
Denial of remorse and gratitude
These criteria have been criticized because they presume a knowledge of intention (for example, the phrase
"pretending to be").[8] Behavior is observable, but intention is not. Thus classification requires assumptions
which need to be tested before they can be asserted as fact, especially considering multiple explanations could
be made as to why a person exhibits these behaviors.

Hotchkiss' seven deadly sins of narcissism
Hotchkiss identified what she called the seven deadly sins of narcissism:[9]
1. Shamelessness: Shame is the feeling that lurks beneath all unhealthy narcissism, and the inability to
process shame in healthy ways.
2. Magical thinking: Narcissists see themselves as perfect, using distortion and illusion known as magical
thinking. They also use projection to "dump" shame onto others.

3. Arrogance: A narcissist who is feeling deflated may "reinflate" their sense of self-importance by
diminishing, debasing, or degrading somebody else.
4. Envy: A narcissist may secure a sense of superiority in the face of another person's ability by using
contempt to minimize the other person or their achievements.
5. Entitlement: Narcissists hold unreasonable expectations of particularly favorable treatment and
automatic compliance because they consider themselves special. Failure to comply is considered an attack
on their superiority, and the perpetrator is considered an "awkward" or "difficult" person. Defiance of
their will is a narcissistic injury that can trigger narcissistic rage.
6. Exploitation: Can take many forms but always involves the exploitation of others without regard for their
feelings or interests. Often the other person is in a subservient position where resistance would be
difficult or even impossible. Sometimes the subservience is not so much real as assumed.
7. Bad boundaries: Narcissists do not recognize that they have boundaries and that others are separate and
are not extensions of themselves. Others either exist to meet their needs or may as well not exist at all.
Those who provide narcissistic supply to the narcissist are treated as if they are part of the narcissist and
are expected to live up to those expectations. In the mind of a narcissist, there is no boundary between
self and other.

Clinical and research aspects
Narcissistic personality disorder
Narcissistic personality disorder affects an estimated 1% of the general population.[10][11] Although most
individuals have some narcissistic traits, high levels of narcissism can manifest themselves in a pathological
form as narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), whereby the patient overestimates his or her abilities and has an
excessive need for admiration and affirmation. A revision of NPD took place in the DSM-5. In this revision,
NPD saw dramatic changes to its definition. The general move towards a dimensional (personality trait-based)
view of the Personality Disorders has been maintained. Some narcissists may have a limited or minimal
capability to experience emotions.[12]

Healthy form
Healthy narcissism is a structural truthfulness of the self, achievement of self and object constancy,
synchronization between the self and the superego and a balance between libidinal and aggressive drives (the
ability to receive gratification from others and the drive for impulse expression). Healthy narcissism forms a
constant, realistic self-interest and mature goals and principles and an ability to form deep object relations.[13] A
feature related to healthy narcissism is the feeling of greatness. This is the antithesis of insecurity or inadequacy.
A required element within normal development
Healthy narcissism might exist in all individuals. Freud said that this is an original state from which the
individual develops the love object. He argued that healthy narcissism is an essential part of normal
development.[4] According to Freud, the love of the parents for their child and their attitude toward their child
could be seen as a revival and reproduction of their own narcissism.[4] The child has an omnipotence of
thought; the parents stimulate that feeling because in their child they see the things that they have never reached
themselves. Compared to neutral observers, parents tend to overvalue the qualities of their child. When parents
act in an extreme opposite style and the child is rejected or inconsistently reinforced depending on the mood of
the parent, the self-needs of the child are not met. Freud contrasts the natural development of active-egoistic and

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism

passive-altruistic tendencies in the individual with narcissism, in the former, and what Trevor Pederson[14]
refers to as echoism, in the latter.
This is the place for two remarks. First, how do we differentiate between the concepts of narcissism
and egoism? Well, narcissism, I believe, is the libidinal complement to egoism. When we speak of
egoism, we have in view only the individual's advantage; when we talk of narcissism we are also
taking his libidinal satisfaction into account. As practical motives the two can be traced separately
for quite a distance. It is possible to be absolutely egoistic and yet maintain powerful objectcathexes, in so far as libidinal satisfaction in relation to the object forms part of the ego's needs. In
that case, egoism will see to it that striving for the object involves no damage to the ego. It is
possible to be egoistic and at the same time to be excessively narcissistic—that is to say, to have
very little need for an object, whether, once more, for the purpose of direct sexual satisfaction, or in
connection with the higher aspirations, derived from sexual need, which we are occasionally in the
habit of contrasting with ‘sensuality’ under the name of ‘love’. In all these connections egoism is
what is self-evident and constant, while narcissism is the variable element. The opposite to egoism,
altruism, does not, as a concept, coincide with libidinal object-cathexis, but is distinguished from it
by the absence of longings for sexual satisfaction. When someone is completely in love, however,
altruism converges with libidinal object-cathexis. As a rule the sexual object attracts a portion of
the ego's narcissism to itself, and this becomes noticeable as what is known as the ‘sexual
overvaluation’ of the object. If in addition there is an altruistic transposition of egoism on to the
sexual object, the object becomes supremely powerful; it has, as it were, absorbed the ego." (Freud,
Introductory Lectures (1919), p. 417-8)
Where the egoist can give up love in narcissism, the altruist can give up on competition, or "the will," in
echoism. In contrast to the feeling of perfection that underwrites the narcissist's grandiosity, Pederson [14]
conceptualizes the echoist as having the feeling of being dead, empty, or nonexistent. Karen Horney saw the
narcissistic personality as a temperament trait molded by a certain kind of early environment. She did not see
narcissistic needs and tendencies as inherent in human nature.[15] Craig Malkin called a lack of healthy
narcissism "echoism" after the nypmh Echo in the mythology of Narcissus.[16]
In relation to the pathological condition
Healthy narcissism has to do with a strong feeling of "own love" protecting the human being against illness.
Eventually, however, the individual must love the other, "the object love to not become ill." The individual
becomes ill as a result of the frustration created when he is unable to love the object.[17] In pathological
narcissism such as the narcissistic personality disorder, the person’s libido has been withdrawn from objects in
the world and produces megalomania. The clinical theorists Kernberg, Kohut and Millon all see pathological
narcissism as a possible outcome in response to unempathic and inconsistent early childhood interactions. They
suggested that narcissists try to compensate in adult relationships.[18] The pathological condition of narcissism
is, as Freud suggested, a magnified, extreme manifestation of healthy narcissism.
With regard to the condition of healthy narcissism, it is suggested that this is correlated with good psychological
health. Self-esteem works as a mediator between narcissism and psychological health. Therefore, because of
their elevated self-esteem, deriving from self-perceptions of competence and likability, high narcissists are
relatively free of worry and gloom.[19] Other researchers suggested that healthy narcissism cannot be seen as
‘good’ or ‘bad’; however, it depends on the contexts and outcomes being measured. In certain social contexts
such as initiating social relationships, and with certain outcome variables, such as feeling good about oneself,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism

healthy narcissism can be helpful. In other contexts, such as maintaining long-term relationships and with other
outcome variables, such as accurate self-knowledge, healthy narcissism can be unhelpful.[20]

Commonly used measures
Narcissistic Personality Inventory
The Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) is the most widely used measure of narcissism in social
psychological research. Although several versions of the NPI have been proposed in the literature, a forty-item
forced-choice version (Raskin & Terry, 1988) is the one most commonly employed in current research. The NPI
is based on the DSM-III clinical criteria for narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), although it was designed to
measure these features in the general population. Thus, the NPI is often said to measure "normal" or
"subclinical" (borderline) narcissism (i.e., in people who score very high on the NPI do not necessarily meet
criteria for diagnosis with NPD).
Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory
The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) is a widely used diagnostic test developed by Theodore
Millon. The MCMI includes a scale for Narcissism. Auerbach compared the NPI and MCMI and found them
well correlated, r(146) = 0.55, p < 0.001.[21] It should be noted that whereas the MCMI measures narcissistic
personality disorder (NPD), the NPI measures narcissism as it occurs in the general population. In other words,
the NPI measures "normal" narcissism; i.e., most people who score very high on the NPI do not have NPD.
Indeed, the NPI does not capture any sort of narcissism taxon as would be expected if it measured NPD.[22]

Empirical studies
Within psychology, there are two main branches of research into narcissism: clinical and social psychology.
These approaches differ in their view of narcissism, with the former treating it as a disorder, thus as discrete,
and the latter treating it as a personality trait, thus as a continuum. These two strands of research tend loosely to
stand in a divergent relation to one another, although they converge in places.
Campbell and Foster (2007)[23] review the literature on narcissism. They argue that narcissists possess the
following "basic ingredients":
Positive: Narcissists think they are better than others.[24]
Inflated: Narcissists' views tend to be contrary to reality. In measures that compare self-report to
objective measures, narcissists' self-views tend to be greatly exaggerated.[25]
Agentic: Narcissists’ views tend to be most exaggerated in the agentic domain, relative to the communion
domain.[24][25]
Special: Narcissists perceive themselves to be unique and special people.[26]
Selfish: Research upon narcissists’ behaviour in resource dilemmas supports the case for narcissists as
being selfish.[27]
Oriented toward success: Narcissists are oriented towards success by being, for example, approach
oriented.[28]
Narcissists tend to demonstrate a lack of interest in warm and caring interpersonal relationships.[23] There are
several ongoing controversies within narcissism literature, namely: whether narcissism is healthy or unhealthy;

a personality disorder; a discrete or continuous variable; defensive or offensive; the same across genders; the
same across cultures; and changeable or unchangeable.
Campbell and Foster (2007) argue that self-regulatory strategies are of paramount importance to understanding
narcissism.[23] Self-regulation in narcissists involves such things as striving to make one’s self look and feel
positive, special, successful and important. It comes in both intra-psychic, such as blaming a situation rather
than self for failure, and interpersonal forms, such as using a relationship to serve one’s own self. Some
differences in self-regulation between narcissists and non-narcissists can be seen with Campbell, Reeder,
Sedikides & Elliot (2000)[29] who conducted a study with two experiments. In each experiment, participants
took part in an achievement task, following which they were provided with false feedback; it was either bogus
success or failure. The study found that both narcissists and non-narcissists self-enhanced, but non-narcissists
showed more flexibility in doing so. Participants were measured on both a comparative and a non-comparative
self-enhancement strategy. Both narcissists and non-narcissists employed the non-comparative strategy
similarly; however, narcissists were found to be more self-serving with the comparative strategy, employing it
far more than non-narcissists, suggesting a greater rigidity in their self-enhancement. When narcissists receive
negative feedback that threatens the self, they self-enhance at all costs, but non-narcissists tend to have limits.
Sorokowski et al. (2015) showed that narcissism is related to the frequency of posting selfie-type pictures on
social media. This relationship was stronger among men than women.[30]

Heritability research using twin studies
Livesley et al. concluded, in agreement with other studies, that narcissism as measured by a standardized test
was a common inherited trait.[31] Additionally, in similar agreement with those other studies, it was found that
there exists a continuum between normal and disordered personality. The study subjects were 175 volunteer
twin pairs (ninety identical, eighty-five fraternal) drawn from the general population. Each twin completed a
questionnaire that assessed eighteen dimensions of personality disorder. The authors estimated the heritability
of each dimension of personality by standard methods, thus providing estimates of the relative contributions of
genetic and environmental causation. Of the eighteen personality dimensions, narcissism was found to have the
highest heritability (0.64), indicating that the concordance of this trait in the identical twins was significantly
influenced by genetics. Of the other dimensions of personality, only four were found to have heritability
coefficients of greater than 0.5: callousness, identity problems, oppositionality and social avoidance.

Stigmatising attitude towards psychiatric illness
Arikan found that a stigmatising attitude to psychiatric patients is associated with narcissistic personality
traits.[32]

In evolutionary psychology
The concept of narcissism is used in evolutionary psychology in relation to the mechanisms of assortative
mating, or the non-random choice of a partner for purposes of procreation. Evidence for assortative mating
among humans is well established; humans mate assortatively regarding age, IQ, height, weight, nationality,
educational and occupational level, physical and personality characteristics, and family relatedness.[33] In the
"self seeking like" hypothesis, individuals unconsciously look for a "mirror image" of themselves in others,
seeking criteria of beauty or reproductive fitness in the context of self-reference. Alvarez et al. found that facial
resemblance between couples was a strong driving force among the mechanisms of assortative mating: human
couples resemble each other significantly more than would be expected from random pair formation.[34] Since

facial characteristics are known to be inherited, the "self seeking like" mechanism may enhance reproduction
between genetically similar mates, favoring the stabilization of genes supporting social behavior, with no kin
relationship among them.

Narcissistic supply
Narcissistic supply is a concept introduced into psychoanalytic theory by Otto Fenichel in 1938, to describe a
type of admiration, interpersonal support or sustenance drawn by an individual from his or her environment and
essential to their self-esteem.[35] The term is typically used in a negative sense, describing a pathological or
excessive need for attention or admiration in codependents and the orally fixated, that does not take into account
the feelings, opinions or preferences of other people.

Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury
Narcissistic rage is a reaction to narcissistic injury, which is a perceived threat to a narcissist's self-esteem or
self-worth. Narcissistic injury (or narcissistic scar) is a phrase used by Sigmund Freud in the 1920s; narcissistic
wound and narcissistic blow are further, almost interchangeable terms.[36] The term narcissistic rage was coined
by Heinz Kohut in 1972. Narcissistic rage occurs on a continuum from instances of aloofness, and expression of
mild irritation or annoyance, to serious outbursts, including violent attacks.[37] Narcissistic rage reactions are
not limited to personality disorders and may be also seen in catatonic, paranoid delusion and depressive
episodes.[37] It has also been suggested that narcissists have two layers of rage. The first layer of rage can be
thought of as a constant anger (towards someone else), with the second layer being a self-aimed wrath.[38]

Narcissistic defences
Narcissistic defences are those processes whereby the idealized aspects of the self are preserved, and its
limitations denied.[39] They tend to be rigid and totalistic.[40] They are often driven by feelings of shame and
guilt, conscious or unconscious.[41]

Narcissistic abuse
Narcissistic abuse is a term that emerged in the late twentieth century, and became more prominent in the early
21st century because of the works of Alice Miller and other Neo-Freudians, rejecting psychoanalysis as being
similar to the poisonous pedagogies.[42] Miller used "narcissistic abuse" to refer to a specific form of emotional
abuse of children by what she considered narcissistic parents – parents who require the child to give up their
own wants and feelings in order to serve the parent's needs for esteem, which constitutes narcissistic abuse.[43]
The term has also come to be used more widely to refer to forms of abuse in adult relationships on the part of
the narcissist. Self-help culture assumes that someone abused by narcissistic parenting as a child likely struggles
with codependency issues in adulthood. An adult who is or has been in a relationship with a narcissist likely
struggles with not knowing what constitutes a "normal" relationship.

Types
Masterson's subtypes (exhibitionist and closet)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism

In 1993, James F. Masterson proposed two categories for pathological narcissism, exhibitionist and closet.[44]
Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects in the quality of
psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in
DSM-IV and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist is more likely to
be described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. The
exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no
conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would assume that this condition was normal and
that others were just like him. The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to
the borderline in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from
others.

Millon's variations
Theodore Millon identified five variations of narcissist.[10] Any individual narcissist may exhibit none or one of
the following:
unprincipled narcissist: including antisocial features. A charlatan—is a fraudulent, exploitative,
deceptive and unscrupulous individual.
amorous narcissist: including histrionic features. The Don Juan or Casanova of our times—is erotic,
exhibitionist.
compensatory narcissist: including negativistic (passive-aggressive), avoidant features.
elitist narcissist: variant of pure pattern. Corresponds to Wilhelm Reich's "phallic narcissistic"
personality type.

Other forms
Acquired situational narcissism
Acquired situational narcissism (ASN) is a form of narcissism that develops in late adolescence or adulthood,
brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of celebrity. It was coined by Robert B. Millman, professor
of psychiatry at the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University. ASN differs from conventional
narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society.
Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other
people, triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to
become a full-blown personality disorder. "Millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used
to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people."[45] In its presentation and symptoms, it is
indistinguishable from narcissistic personality disorder, differing only in its late onset and its support by large
numbers of others. "The lack of social norms, controls, and of people telling them how life really is, also makes
these people believe they're invulnerable,"[46] so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable
relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is Norma
Desmond, the main character of Sunset Boulevard.
Codependency
Codependency is a tendency to behave in overly passive or excessively caretaking ways that negatively impact
one's relationships and quality of life. Narcissists are considered to be natural magnets for the codependent.
Rappoport identifies codependents of narcissists as "co-narcissists".[47]

Collective or group narcissism
Collective narcissism (or group narcissism) is a type of narcissism where an individual has an inflated self-love
of his or her own ingroup, where an "ingroup" is a group in which an individual is personally involved.[48]
While the classic definition of narcissism focuses on the individual, collective narcissism asserts that one can
have a similar excessively high opinion of a group, and that a group can function as a narcissistic entity.[48]
Collective narcissism is related to ethnocentrism; however, ethnocentrism primarily focuses on
self-centeredness at an ethnic or cultural level, while collective narcissism is extended to any type of ingroup
beyond just cultures and ethnicities.[48][49]
Conversational narcissism
Conversational narcissism is a term used by sociologist Charles Derber in his book, The Pursuit of Attention:
Power and Ego in Everyday Life. Derber observed that the social support system in America is relatively weak,
and this leads people to compete mightily for attention. In social situations, they tend to steer the conversation
away from others and toward themselves. "Conversational narcissism is the key manifestation of the dominant
attention-getting psychology in America," he wrote. "It occurs in informal conversations among friends, family
and coworkers. The profusion of popular literature about listening and the etiquette of managing those who talk
constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life." What Derber describes as
"conversational narcissism" often occurs subtly rather than overtly because it is prudent to avoid being judged
an egotist. Derber distinguishes the "shift-response" from the "support-response," as in the following two
hypothetical conversation fragments:
John: I'm feeling really starved.
Mary: Oh, I just ate. (shift-response)

John: I'm feeling really starved.
Mary: When was the last time you ate?
(support-response)

Cultural narcissism
In The Culture of Narcissism, Christopher Lasch defines a narcissistic culture as one where every activity and
relationship is defined by the hedonistic need to acquire the symbols of wealth,[50] this becoming the only
expression of rigid, yet covert, social hierarchies. It is a culture where liberalism only exists insofar as it serves
a consumer society, and even art, sex and religion lose their liberating power. In such a society of constant
competition, there can be no allies, and little transparency. The threats to acquisitions of social symbols are so
numerous, varied and frequently incomprehensible, that defensiveness, as well as competitiveness, becomes a
way of life. Any real sense of community is undermined—or even destroyed—to be replaced by virtual
equivalents that strive, unsuccessfully, to synthesize a sense of community.
Destructive narcissism
Destructive narcissism is the constant exhibition of numerous and intense characteristics usually associated with
the pathological narcissist but having fewer characteristics than pathological narcissism.[51]
Malignant narcissism
Malignant narcissism, a term first coined in a book by Erich Fromm in 1964,[52] is a syndrome consisting of a
cross breed of the narcissistic personality disorder, the antisocial personality disorder, as well as paranoid traits.

11/30/2016 7:07 PM

Narcissism - Wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism

The malignant narcissist differs from one suffering from narcissistic personality disorder in that the malignant
narcissist derives higher levels of psychological gratification from accomplishments over time (thus worsening
the disorder). Because the malignant narcissist becomes more involved in this psychological gratification, in the
context of the right conditions, the narcissist is apt to develop the antisocial, the paranoid, and the schizoid
personality disorders. The term malignant is added to the term narcissist to indicate that individuals with this
disorder have a powerful form of narcissism that has made them ill in the forms of paranoid and anti-social
traits.
Medical narcissism
Medical narcissism is a term coined by John Banja in his book, Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism.[53][54]
Banja defines "medical narcissism" as the need of health professionals to preserve their self-esteem leading to
the compromise of error disclosure to patients. In the book he explores the psychological, ethical and legal
effects of medical errors and the extent to which a need to constantly assert their competence can cause
otherwise capable, and even exceptional, professionals to fall into narcissistic traps. He claims that:
...most health professionals (in fact, most professionals of any ilk) work on cultivating a self that
exudes authority, control, knowledge, competence and respectability. It's the narcissist in us
all—we dread appearing stupid or incompetent.
In the workplace
Narcissism as a personality trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, is related to
some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories are more
likely to engage in counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people
in the workplace).[55] Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and
counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened.[56] Thus narcissistic
employees are more likely to engage in CWB when they feel threatened.[57] Individuals high in narcissism have
fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are
more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals
who are low on narcissism.[58]
The narcissistic manager will have two main sources of narcissistic supply: inanimate – status symbols like
company cars, company-issued smartphone or prestigious offices with window views; and animate – flattery
and attention from colleagues and subordinates.[59] Teammates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn
them into enabling sources of permanent supply, unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries.[60]
The need to protect such supply networks will prevent the narcissistic managers from taking objective
decisions;[61] while long-term strategies will be evaluated according to their potential for attention-gaining for
the manager themself.[62] Organizational psychologist Alan Downs wrote a book in 1997 describing corporate
narcissism.[63] He explores high-profile corporate leaders (such as Al Dunlap and Robert Allen) who, he
suggests, literally have only one thing on their minds: profits. According to Downs, such narrow focus actually
may yield positive short-term benefits, but ultimately it drags down individual employees as well as entire
companies. Alternative thinking is proposed, and some firms now utilizing these options are examined. Downs'
theories are relevant to those suggested by Victor Hill in his book, Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms
Australia.[64]

Primordial narcissism
Psychiatrist Ernst Simmel first defined primordial narcissism in 1944.[65] Simmel's fundamental thesis is that
the most primitive stage of libidinal development is not the oral, but the gastrointestinal one. Mouth and anus
are merely to be considered as the terminal parts of this organic zone. Simmel terms the psychological condition
of prenatal existence "primordial narcissism." It is the vegetative stage of the pre-ego, identical with the id. At
this stage there is complete instinctual repose, manifested in unconsciousness. Satiation of the gastrointestinal
zone, the representative of the instinct of self-preservation, can bring back this complete instinctual repose,
which, under pathological conditions, can become the aim of the instinct. Contrary to Lasch, Bernard Stiegler
argues in his book, Acting Out, that consumer capitalism is in fact destructive of what he calls primordial
narcissism, without which it is not possible to extend love to others.[66] In other words, he is referring to the
natural state of an infant as a fetus and in the first few days of its life, before it has learned that other people
exist besides itself, and therefore cannot possibly be aware that they are human beings with feelings, rather than
having anything to do with actual narcissism.
Sexual narcissism
Sexual narcissism has been described as an egocentric pattern of sexual behavior that involves an inflated sense
of sexual ability and sexual entitlement. In addition, sexual narcissism is the erotic preoccupation with oneself
as a superb lover through a desire to merge sexually with a mirror image of oneself. Sexual narcissism is an
intimacy dysfunction in which sexual exploits are pursued, generally in the form of extramarital affairs, to
overcompensate for low self-esteem and an inability to experience true intimacy.[67] This behavioral pattern is
believed to be more common in men than in women and has been tied to domestic violence in men and sexual
coercion in couples.[68][69] Hurlbert argues that sex is a natural biological given and therefore cannot be deemed
as an addiction. He and his colleagues assert that any sexual addiction is nothing more than a misnomer for
what is actually sexual narcissism or sexual compulsivity.[70] While Hurlbert writes mainly of sexual narcissism
in men, Schoenewolf (2013) describes what he calls "gender narcissism" which occurs in both males and
females who compensate for feelings of sexual inadequacy by becoming overly proud and obsessed with their
masculinity or femininity.[71]

Narcissistic parents
Narcissistic parents demand certain behavior from their children because they see the children as extensions of
themselves, and need the children to represent them in the world in ways that meet the parents’ emotional
needs. This parenting 'style' most often results in estranged relationships with the children, coupled with
feelings of resentment and self-destructive tendencies.[47]

Narcissistic leadership
Narcissistic leadership is a common form of leadership. The narcissism may be healthy or destructive although
there is a continuum between the two. A study published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology
Bulletin suggests that when a group is without a leader, you can often count on a narcissist to take charge.
Researchers found that people who score high in narcissism tend to emerge as group leader.[72]

Popular culture
Some critics contend that pop culture has become more narcissistic in recent decades.[74] This claim is

frequency with
which "reality TV"
programs populate the television schedules,[74] and the growth of an online culture in which digital media,
social media and the "will-to-fame" are generating a "new era of public narcissism [that] is mutating with new
media forms."[76] In this analysis, narcissism, rather than being the pathologized property of a discrete
personality type, has been asserted as a constituent cultural feature of an entire generation since the end of
World War II.[77]
Supporting the contention that American culture has become more narcissistic and that this is increasingly
reflected in its cultural products is an analysis of US popular song lyrics between 1987 and 2007. This found a
growth in the use of first-person singular pronouns, reflecting a greater focus on the self, and also of references
to antisocial behavior; during the same period, there was a diminution of words reflecting a focus on others,
positive emotions, and social interactions.[78][79] Similar patterns of change in cultural production are
observable in other Western states. A linguistic analysis of the largest circulation Norwegian newspaper found
that the use of self-focused and individualistic terms increased in frequency by 69 per cent between 1984 and
2005 while collectivist terms declined by 32 per cent.[79] References to narcissism and self-esteem in American
popular print media have experienced vast inflation since the late 1980s.[79] Between 1987 and 2007 direct
mentions of self-esteem in leading US newspapers and magazines increased by 4,540 per cent while narcissism,
which had been almost non-existent in the press during the 1970s, was referred to over 5,000 times between
2002 and 2007.[79]
Cross-cultural studies of differences in narcissism are rare. Instead, as there is a positive association between
narcissism and individualism and a negative one between it and collectivism, these traits have been used as
proxies for narcissism in some studies.[80] This approach, however, risks the misapplication of the concepts of
individualism and collectivism to create overly-fixed, "caricature-like",[81] oppositional categories.[82]
Nonetheless, one study looked at differences in advertising products between an individualistic culture,
America, and a collectivist one, South Korea. In American magazine advertisements, it found, there was a
greater tendency to stress the distinctiveness and uniqueness of the person; conversely the South Korean ones
stressed the importance of social conformity and harmony.[80] This observation holds true for a cross-cultural
analysis across a wide range of cultural outputs where individualistic national cultures produce more
individualistic cultural products and collectivist national cultures produce more collectivist national products;
these cultural effects were greater than the effects of individual differences within national cultures.[80]

Fictional narcissists
Jay Gatsby, the eponymous character of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel The Great Gatsby, "an archetype
of self-made American men seeking to join high society," has been described as a "pathological
narcissist" for whom the "ego-ideal" has become "inflated and destructive" and whose "grandiose lies,
poor sense of reality, sense of entitlement, and exploitive treatment of others" conspire toward his own
demise.[83]
In the film To Die For, Nicole Kidman's character wants to appear on television at all costs, even if this

involves murdering her husband. A psychiatric assessment of her character noted that she "was seen as a
prototypical narcissistic person by the raters: on average, she satisfied 8 of 9 criteria for narcissistic
personality disorder... had she been evaluated for personality disorders, she would receive a diagnosis of
narcissistic personality disorder."[84]
Gordon Gekko is a fictional character in the 1987 film Wall Street and its 2010 sequel Wall Street: Money
Never Sleeps,.[85] Gekko has become a symbol in popular culture for unrestrained greed and self-interest
(with the signature line, "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good"), often in fields outside corporate
finance.
Charles Foster Kane is a fictional character and the subject of Orson Welles' 1941 film Citizen Kane. The
character is widely believed to be based on publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Welles played
Kane (receiving an Oscar nomination), with Buddy Swan playing Kane as a child. Welles also produced,
co-wrote and directed the film. Citizen Kane explores the life of the titular character, who is born of
humble origins. In 1871, Kane's mother puts him under the guardianship of a New York City banker
named Walter Parks Thatcher, who raises him in luxury. As an adult, Kane takes control of a newspaper,
which he uses to advance businesses in which Kane holds stock. Kane also hires staff members away
from the rival Chronicle newspaper, regarding them as collectibles. To finance the fledgling Inquirer,
Kane uses his personal resources; this would allow him to operate it, even at a million dollar annual loss,
for decades.

Psychopathy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Psychopathy (/saɪˈkɒpəθi/), sometimes used synonymously
with sociopathy (/soʊsiˈɒpəθi/), is traditionally defined as a
personality disorder[1] characterized by persistent antisocial
behavior, impaired empathy and remorse, and bold,
disinhibited, egotistical traits. Different conceptions of
psychopathy have been used throughout history. These
conceptions are only partly overlapping and may sometimes
be contradictory.[2]

diagnoses have been referred to (or include what is referred
to) as psychopathy or sociopathy. Canadian psychologist
Robert D. Hare later repopularized the construct of psychopathy in criminology with his Psychopathy Checklist.
[2][4][5][6][7]

Although no psychiatric or psychological organization has sanctioned a diagnosis titled "psychopathy",
assessments of psychopathic characteristics are widely used in criminal justice settings in some nations, and
may have important consequences for individuals. The study of psychopathy is an active field of research, and
the term is also used by the general public, in popular press, and in fictional portrayals.[7][8] While the term is
often employed in common usage along with the related but distinct "crazy", "insane" and "mentally ill",
criminal psychology researcher Robert Hare stresses that a clear distinction is known among clinicians and
researchers between psychopathic and psychotic individuals. Hare claims that psychopaths "are not disoriented
or out of touch with reality, nor do they experience the delusions, hallucinations, or intense subjective distress
that characterize most other mental disorders. Unlike psychotic individuals, psychopaths are rational and aware
of what they are doing and why. Their behavior is the result of choice, freely exercised."[9]

Conceptions
Researchers have noted that there appear to be at least two different conceptions of psychopathy, each with
differing policy implications. Jennifer L. Skeem et al. distinguished Cleckleyan psychopathy (named after
Hervey Cleckley's early conception of psychopathy, entailing bold, disinhibited behavior, low anxiety and
"feckless disregard") and criminal psychopathy (a "meaner, more aggressively disinhibited conception of
psychopathy that explicitly entails persistent and sometimes serious criminal behavior", typically
operationalized with the Psychopathy Checklist), the latter of which is used as the modern clinical concept. Due
to the profound implications that a label of "psychopath" can have—including in terms of decisions about
punishment severity, treatment, etc.—efforts have been made to clarify the meaning of the term, e.g. by
reconciling seemingly disparate conceptions such as those mentioned.[2]
Triarchic model

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy

The triarchic model, formulated by Christopher J. Patrick et al., suggests that different conceptions of
psychopathy emphasize three observable characteristics to varying degrees. Analyses have been made with
respect to the applicability of measurement tools such as the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL, PCL-R) and
Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) to this model.[1][2]
Boldness. Low fear including stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, and high
self-confidence and social assertiveness. The PCL-R measures this relatively poorly and mainly through
Facet 1 of Factor 1. Similar to PPI Fearless dominance. May correspond to differences in the amygdala
and other neurological systems associated with fear.[1][2] Psychopaths are notorious for their lack of
fear.[10]
Disinhibition. Poor impulse control including problems with planning and foresight, lacking affect and
urge control, demand for immediate gratification, and poor behavioral restraints. Similar to PCL-R Factor
2 and PPI Impulsive antisociality. May correspond to impairments in frontal lobe systems that are
involved in such control.[1][2]
Meanness. Lacking empathy and close attachments with others, disdain of close attachments, use of
cruelty to gain empowerment, exploitative tendencies, defiance of authority, and destructive excitement
seeking. The PCL-R in general is related to this but in particular some elements in Factor 1. Similar to
PPI Coldheartedness but also includes elements of subscales in Impulsive antisociality.[1][2]

Measurement
An early and influential analysis from Harris and colleagues indicated a discrete category may underlie PCL-R
psychopathy, but this was only found for the behavioral Factor 2 items.[11] Marcus, John, and Edens more
recently performed a series of statistical analyses on PPI scores and concluded psychopathy may best be
conceptualized as having a "dimensional latent structure" like depression.[12]
Marcus et al. repeated the study on a larger sample of prisoners, using the PCL-R and seeking to rule out other
experimental or statistical issues that may have produced the previously different findings. They again found
that the psychopathy measurements do not appear to be identifying a discrete type (a taxon). They suggest that
while for legal or other practical purposes an arbitrary cut-off point on trait scores might be used, there is
actually no clear scientific evidence for an objective point of difference by which to label some people
"psychopaths;" in other words, a "psychopath" may be more accurately described as someone who is "relatively
psychopathic".[2][13]
The PCL-R was developed for research, not clinical forensic diagnosis, and even for research purposes to
improve understanding of the underlying issues, it is necessary to examine dimensions of personality in general
rather than only a constellation of traits.[2][14]

Personality dimensions
There are different views as to which personality dimensions are more central in regard to psychopathy. Besides
dimensions described elsewhere in this article, studies have linked psychopathy to alternative dimensions such
as antagonism (high), conscientiousness (low) and anxiousness (low, or sometimes high). Psychopathy has also
been linked to high psychoticism—a theorized dimension referring to tough, aggressive or hostile tendencies.
Aspects of this that appear associated with psychopathy are lack of socialization and responsibility, impulsivity,
sensation-seeking (in some cases), and aggression.[15][16][17]
Otto Kernberg, from a particular psychoanalytic perspective, believed psychopathy should be considered as part

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy

of a spectrum of pathological narcissism, that would range from narcissistic personality on the low end,
malignant narcissism in the middle, and psychopathy at the high end.[17] However, narcissism is generally seen
as only one possible aspect of psychopathy as broadly defined.
Psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism, three personality traits that are together referred to as the dark
triad, share certain characteristics, such as a callous-manipulative interpersonal style. The dark tetrad refers to
these traits with the addition of sadism.[18][19][20][21][22][23]

Criticism
Some critics of the diagnosis of psychopathy state that the criterion of lack of obedience to law is incompatible
with that of lack of empathy, stating that the results of the Milgram experiment can be transferred to cases in
which the "orders" are in fact laws and that similar justifications can be built into the rhetorics that allege
certain laws with effects that lead to suffering to be necessary today.[24][25]
Other critics state that since psychopaths tend to be described as manipulative, anything a person who is alleged
to be a psychopath does for the good of others can be explained away as manipulation, and that this makes the
diagnosis non-falsifiable and therefore unscientific.[26][27]
Referring to the low degree of correlation between psychopathic traits in early adolescence and those in
adulthood (compared to between childhood and adulthood), certain critics of the concept of psychopathy
explore the predictions of the concept in terms of evolutionary effects of different minimum ages in different
jurisdictions. In this context, these critics cite that the reason why evolution is often a slow process is because it
statistically takes a long time for the right mutations to appear, while selection can create group differences
rapidly if individual hereditary variation is already in place. Therefore, these critics argue, if psychopathy was a
neurologically valid concept, different ages of majority, ages of criminal responsibility and so on would have
selected for different brain development rates at the centuries to a few millennia timeframe and created different
age distributions of violent crimes in people with genetic heritage from countries with currently or relatively
historically recently different minimum ages. These critics argue that the absence of such differences disproves
psychopathy as a neurological concept at a general level, without contradicting the viewpoint that it would have
been non-falsifiable at an individual level were there no general level to test.[28][29][30]
Another evolutionarily informed criticism of the brain development view of social behavior including
psychopathy cites computer simulations which prove that simple reactions without complex brains are sufficient
to generate seemingly complex social behavior as well as social behavior in extremely small-brained animals
such as insects. These critics argue that since all means by which evolution can select for altruism, including kin
selection and mutual aid, can select only on the effects of the altruistic behavior for the beneficiaries and not on
the altruistic individual's intentions, and large brains consume more nutrients which increases the nutritional
needs of the individual and are therefore negative to altruistic behavior, evolutionary selection for pro-social
behavior would always select for simple reactions and not for complex mechanisms that takes a long time to
develop and/or keeps consuming large amounts of nutrients throughout life.[31][32][33]
Others criticize neurological link interpretations of criminological studies regarding psychopathy for
incompatibility with evolutionary models of empathy as an extension from closer kin to more distant kin. These
critics point out a contradiction between criminological studies that state that people who abuse animals are
likely to abuse other humans but not vice versa on one hand, and the evolutionary implications of the fact that
other humans are closer kin and nonhuman animals more distant kin to humans on the other. The argument is
that for incremental evolution, the more primitive function is always a necessary but not sufficient condition for
the more derived function and never the other way around, and that therefore the biopsychiatric model predicts

that for humans, empathy with other humans should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for empathy
with nonhuman animals and not the other way. These critics argue that the evolutionarily absurd gripe of the
criminological studies support the idea of psychopathic behavior as a sociological stigmatization effect, with a
note that hereditary characteristics biologically unrelated to behavior can be subject to stereotypes that are
pervasive in society and thereby give an appearance of being linked to behaviors.[34][35]
Criticisms along these lines also discount the notion of nonhuman animals in general being comparable to
infants due to adult humans being more childlike than most adult nonhuman animals physically and
criminological studies claiming links to apply even if the nonhuman animals involved are larger than adult
humans. For behavioral characteristics such as inability or limited ability to be aware of one's actions, these
critics cite that empathy specifically aimed at individuals with a lower degree of certain characteristics would
have selected for a decrease and not an increase of the characteristics over the course of evolution, and if
humans empathized specifically with individuals less capable of choosing their actions would have left humans
less able than other animals to choose their actions, not more able to do so.[36][37][38]

Signs and symptoms
Psychopathy is a personality disorder which has symptoms expressed over a wide range of settings. Socially, it
expresses extensive callous and manipulative self-serving behaviors with no regard for others, and often is
associated with repeated delinquency, crime and violence, but may also present itself in other, maybe even
successful social settings. Mentally, impairments in processes related to affect (emotion) and cognition,
particularly socially related mental processes, have been found in those with the disorder which suggest that
their destructive social behavior is borne from these aberrant mental processes. Developmentally, symptoms of
psychopathy have been identified in young children with conduct disorder, and is suggestive of at least a partial
constitutional factor that influences its development.[39]

Offending
Criminality
In terms of simple correlations, the PCL-R manual states an average
score of 22.1 has been found in North American prisoner samples, and
that 20.5% scored 30 or higher. An analysis of prisoner samples from
outside North America found a somewhat lower average value of 17.5.
Studies have found that psychopathy scores correlated with repeated
imprisonment, detention in higher security, disciplinary infractions, and
substance misuse.[40][41]
Psychopathy, as measured with the PCL-R in institutional settings,
shows in meta-analyses small to moderate effect sizes with institutional

adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples, community samples, and
youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending. This
small to moderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past
criminal history, which are well-established but very general risk factors. The aspects of core personality often
held to be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. For
example, Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to crime,

11/30/2016 7:08 PM

Psychopathy - Wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy

including violent crime. In contrast, Factor 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated more
strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength to that of the PCL-R as a whole. The
antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior
which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past criminal behavior,
suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor. Thus, the concept of psychopathy may perform
poorly when attempted to be used as a general theory of crime.[2][42]
Violence
Studies have suggested a strong correlation between psychopathy scores and violence, and the PCL-R
emphasizes features that are somewhat predictive of violent behavior. Researchers, however, have noted that
psychopathy is dissociable from and not synonymous with violence.[2][43]
It has been suggested that psychopathy is associated with "instrumental", also known as predatory, proactive, or
"cold blooded" aggression, a form of aggression characterized by reduced emotion and conducted with a goal
differing from but facilitated by the commission of harm.[44][45] One conclusion in this regard was made by a
2002 study of homicide offenders, which reported that the homicides committed by homicidal offenders with
psychopathy were almost always (93.3%) primarily instrumental, significantly more than the proportion
(48.4%) of those committed by non-psychopathic homicidal offenders, with the instrumentality of the homicide
also correlated with the total PCL-R score of the offender as well as their scores on the Factor 1 "interpersonalaffective" dimension. However, contrary to the equating of this to mean exclusively "in cold blood", more than
a third of the homicides committed by psychopathic offenders involved some component of emotional reactivity
as well.[46] In any case, FBI profilers indicate that serious victim injury is generally an emotional offense, and
some research supports this, at least with regard to sexual offending. One study has found more serious
offending by non-psychopathic offenders on average than by offenders with psychopathy (e.g. more homicides
versus more armed robbery and property offenses) and another that the Affective facet of the PCL-R predicted
reduced offense seriousness.[2]
Studies on perpetrators of domestic violence find that abusers have high rates of psychopathy, with the
prevalence estimated to be at around 15-30%. Furthermore, the commission of domestic violence is correlated
with Factor 1 of the PCL-R, which describes the emotional deficits and the callous and exploitative
interpersonal style found in psychopathy. The prevalence of psychopathy among domestic abusers indicate that
the core characteristics of psychopathy, such as callousness, remorselessness, and a lack of close interpersonal
bonds, predispose those with psychopathy to committing domestic abuse, and suggest that the domestic abuses
committed by these individuals are callously perpetrated (i.e. instrumentally aggressive) rather than a case of
emotional aggression and therefore may not be amenable to the types of psychosocial interventions commonly
given to domestic abuse perpetrators.[45][47]
Some clinicians suggest that assessment of the construct of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to
violence risk assessment. A large systematic review and meta-regression found that the PCL performed the
poorest out of nine tools for predicting violence. In addition, studies conducted by the authors or translators of
violence prediction measures, including the PCL, show on average more positive results than those conducted
by more independent investigators. There are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict
further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R and some of these are considerably easier, quicker, and less
expensive to administrate. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as
age, gender, number of previous convictions and age of first conviction. Some of these assessments may also
identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes that may help short-term management, identify
more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk, and may have established specific probabilities of offending
for specific scores. Nonetheless, the PCL-R may continue to be popular for risk assessment because of its

pioneering role and the large amount of research done using it.[2][48][49][50][51][52][53]
The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that psychopathic behavior is consistent with traits common to
some serial killers, including sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, impulsivity, the need for control, and
predatory behavior.[54] It has also been found that the homicide victims of psychopathic offenders were
disproportionately female in comparison to the more equitable gender distribution of victims of
non-psychopathic offenders.[46]
Sexual offending
Psychopathy has been associated with commission of sexual crime, with some researchers arguing that it is
correlated with a preference for violent sexual behavior. A 2011 study of conditional releases for Canadian male
federal offenders found that psychopathy was related to more violent and non-violent offences but not more
sexual offences. For child molesters, psychopathy was associated with more offences.[55] A study on the
relationship between psychopathy scores and types of aggression in a sample of sexual murderers, in which
84.2% of the sample had PCL-R scores above 20 and 47.4% above 30, found that 82.4% of those with scores
above 30 had engaged in sadistic violence (defined as enjoyment indicated by self-report or evidence) compared
to 52.6% of those with scores below 30, and total PCL-R and Factor 1 scores correlated significantly with
sadistic violence.[56][57] Despite this, it is reported that offenders with psychopathy (both sexual and non-sexual
offenders) are about 2.5 times more likely to be granted conditional release compared to non-psychopathic
offenders.[55]
In considering the issue of possible reunification of some sex offenders into homes with a non-offending parent
and children, it has been advised that any sex offender with a significant criminal history should be assessed on
the PCL-R, and if they score 18 or higher than they should be excluded from any consideration of being placed
in a home with children under any circumstances.[58] There is, however, increasing concern that PCL scores are
too inconsistent between different examiners, including in its use to evaluate sex offenders.[59]
Other offending
Researchers have discussed the possibility of psychopathy being associated with organized crime, economic
crime and war crimes. Terrorists are sometimes considered psychopathic, and comparisons may be drawn with
traits such as antisocial violence, a selfish world view that precludes the welfare of others, a lack of remorse or
guilt, and blame externalization. However, John Horgan, author of The Psychology of Terrorism, argues that
such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely: for example, to soldiers in wars. It has also been noted
that coordinated terrorist activity requires organization, loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme
of sacrificing oneself for an ideological cause. Traits such as a self-centered disposition, unreliability, poor
behavioral controls, and unusual behaviors may disadvantage or preclude psychopathic individuals in
conducting organized terrorism.[60][61]
It has been speculated that a significant portion with the disorder may be socially successful, tending to express
their antisocial behavior through more covert avenues such as social manipulation or white collar crime. Such
individuals are sometimes referred to as "successful psychopaths", and may not necessarily always have
extensive histories of traditional antisocial behavior as characteristic of traditional psychopathy.[62]

Childhood and adolescent precursors
The PCL:YV is an adaptation of the PCL-R for individuals aged 13–18 years. It is, like the PCL-R, done by a

trained rater based on an interview and an examination of criminal and other records. The "Antisocial Process
Screening Device" (APSD) is also an adaptation of the PCL-R. It can be administered by parents or teachers for
individuals aged 6–13 years. High psychopathy scores for both juveniles, as measured with these instruments,
and adults, as measured with the PCL-R and other measurement tools, have similar associations with other
variables, including similar ability in predicting violence and criminality.[2][63][64] Juvenile psychopathy may
also be associated with more negative emotionality such as anger, hostility, anxiety, and depression.[2]
Psychopathic traits in youth typically comprise three factors: callous/unemotional, narcissism, and
impulsivity/irresponsibility.[65]
There are moderate to high correlations between psychopathy rankings from late childhood to early
adolescence. The correlations are considerably lower from early- or mid-adolescence to adulthood. In one study
most of the similarities were on the Impulsive- and Antisocial-Behavior scales. Of those adolescents who scored
in the top 5% highest psychopathy scores at age 13, less than one third (29%) were classified as psychopathic at
age 24. Some recent studies have also found poorer ability at predicting long-term, adult offending.[2]
Conduct disorder
Conduct disorder is diagnosed based on a prolonged pattern of antisocial behavior in childhood and/or
adolescence, and may be seen as a precursor to ASPD. Some researchers have speculated that there are two
subtypes of conduct disorder which mark dual developmental pathways to adult psychopathy.[2][66][67] The
DSM allows differentiating between childhood onset before age 10 and adolescent onset at age 10 and later.
Childhood onset is argued to be more due to a personality disorder caused by neurological deficits interacting
with an adverse environment. For many, but not all, childhood onset is associated with what is in Terrie
Moffitt's developmental theory of crime referred to as "life-course- persistent" antisocial behavior as well as
poorer health and economic status. Adolescent onset is argued to more typically be associated with short-term
antisocial behavior.[2]
It has been suggested that the combination of early-onset conduct disorder and ADHD may be associated with
life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this combination is
more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not a particularly distinct
group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have ADHD. Some evidence
indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They
may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and
the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adult psychopaths. Proponents of different
types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy
and increased disinhibition in the triarchic model.[2]
The DSM-5 includes a specifier for those with conduct disorder who also display a callous, unemotional
interpersonal style across multiple settings and relationships. The specifier is based on research which suggests
that those with conduct disorder who also meet criteria for the specifier tend to have a more severe form of the
disorder with an earlier onset as well as a different response to treatment. Proponents of different
types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this as possibly corresponding to adult primary psychopathy and
increased boldness and/or meanness in the triarchic model.[2][68]

Dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala regions of the brain have been associated with specific
learning impairments in psychopathy. Since the 1980s, scientists have linked traumatic brain injury, including
damage to these regions, with violent and psychopathic behavior. Patients with damage in such areas resembled
"psychopathic individuals" whose brains were incapable of acquiring social and moral knowledge; those who
acquired damage as children may have trouble conceptualizing social or moral reasoning, while those with
adult-acquired damage may be aware of proper social and moral conduct but be unable to behave appropriately.
Dysfunctions in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex may also impair stimulus-reinforced learning
in psychopaths, whether punishment-based or reward-based. People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an
associated history of violent behavior, appear to have significantly reduced mean microstructural integrity in
their uncinate fasciculus—white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. There is evidence
from DT-MRI, of breakdowns in the white matter connections between these two important areas.[69][70]
[71][72][73]

Although some studies have suggested inverse relationships between psychopathy and intelligence, including
with regards to verbal IQ, Hare and Neumann state that a large literature demonstrates at most only a weak
association between psychopathy and IQ, noting that the early pioneer Cleckley included good intelligence in
his checklist due to selection bias (since many of his patients were "well educated and from middle-class or
upper-class backgrounds") and that "there is no obvious theoretical reason why the disorder described by
Cleckley or other clinicians should be related to intelligence; some psychopaths are bright, others less so".
Studies also indicate that different aspects of the definition of psychopathy (e.g. interpersonal, affective
(emotion), behavioral and lifestyle components) can show different links to intelligence, and the result can
depend on the type of intelligence assessment (e.g. verbal, creative, practical, analytical).[8][43][74]
Emotion recognition and empathy
A large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with
atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of
fear and sadness), including decreased activation of the fusiform and
extrastriate cortical regions, which may partly account for impaired
recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of
fear, and impairments of empathy.[39] The underlying biological surfaces
for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in
psychopaths, although less responsive than those of controls. The
neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to
particular emotions such as fear. Some recent fMRI studies have
reported that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive
across emotions (positives and negatives).[75][76][77][78][79] Studies on
children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such
associations.[79][80][81][82][83][84] Meta-analyses have also found
evidence of impairments in both vocal and facial emotional recognition
for several emotions (i.e., not only fear and sadness) in both adults and
children/adolescents.[85]

Abnormal patterns of brain activity
are observed in children with callousunemotional and psychopathic traits
when viewing others in painful
situations.

A recent study using offenders with psychopathy found that under certain circumstances they could willfully
empathize with others. Functional neuroimaging was performed while the subjects were watching videos of a
person harming another individual. While reduced empathic brain activation relative to the controls was
observed in the control condition, the empathic reaction of the psychopathic offenders initiated the same way it
did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain
relating to pain was activated when the psychopathic offenders were asked to imagine how the harmed

individual felt. The research suggests that individuals with psychopathy could switch empathy on at will, which
would enable them to be both callous as well as charming. The team who conducted the study say it is still
unknown how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they
propose it could be possible to bring psychopaths closer to rehabilitation by helping them to activate their
"empathy switch". Others suggested that despite the results of the study, it remained unclear whether the
experience of empathy by these psychopathic individuals was the same as that of controls, and also questioned
the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.
[86][87][88]

Work conducted by Jean Decety with large samples of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy offers
additional insights. In one study, the offenders were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being
intentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain.
The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, amygdala and periaqueductal gray parts of the brain, but more activity in the striatum and the
insula when compared to control participants.[89] In a second study, the subjects with psychopathy exhibited a
strong response in pain-affective brain regions when taking an imagine-self perspective, but failed to recruit the
neural circuits that were activated in controls during an imagine-other perspective—in particular the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala—which may contribute to their lack of empathic concern.[90]
Despite studies suggesting deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain, professor Simon
Baron-Cohen claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy, which would imply an intact
ability to read and respond to behaviors, social cues and what others are feeling. Psychopathy is, however,
associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy—affective (emotional) empathy—which
includes the ability to feel the suffering and emotions of others (what scientists would term as emotional
contagion), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims. Those on
the autism spectrum, on the other hand, are often deficient in both the affective and cognitive facets of
empathy.[91]
Moral judgment
Psychopathy has been associated with amorality—an absence of, indifference towards, or disregard for moral
beliefs. There are few firm data on patterns of moral judgment. Studies of developmental level (sophistication)
of moral reasoning found all possible results—lower, higher or the same as non-psychopaths. Studies that
compared judgments of personal moral transgressions versus judgments of breaking conventional rules or laws
found that psychopaths rated them as equally severe, whereas non-psychopaths rated the rule-breaking as less
severe.[92]
A study comparing judgments of whether personal or impersonal harm would be endorsed in order to achieve
the rationally maximum (utilitarian) amount of welfare found no significant differences between subjects high
and low in psychopathy. However, a further study using the same tests found that prisoners scoring high on the
PCL were more likely to endorse impersonal harm or rule violations than non-psychopathic controls were. The
psychopathic offenders who scored low in anxiety were also more willing to endorse personal harm on
average.[92]
Assessing accidents, where one person harmed another unintentionally, psychopaths judged such actions to be
more morally permissible. This result has been considered a reflection of psychopaths' failure to appreciate the
emotional aspect of the victim's harmful experience.[93]

Causes
Studies have identified potential genetic and non-genetic contributors to psychopathy, including influences on
brain function. Proponents of the triarchic model believe that psychopathy results from the interaction of genetic
predispositions and an adverse environment. What is adverse may differ depending on the underlying
predisposition: for example, it is hypothesized that persons having high boldness may respond poorly to
punishment but may respond better to rewards and secure attachments.[1][2]

Genetic
Studies of the personality characteristics typical of individuals with psychopathy have found moderate genetic
(as well as non-genetic) influences. On the PPI, fearless dominance and impulsive antisociality were similarly
influenced by genetics and uncorrelated with each other. Genetic factors may generally influence the
development of psychopathy while environmental factors affect the specific expression of the traits that
predominate. A study on a large group of children found more than 60% heritability for "callous-unemotional
traits" and that conduct problems among children with these traits had a higher heritability than among children
without these traits.[2][74][94]
Studies have suggested a connection between the impulsive, aggressive and violent behavior associated with
antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy and a low-activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A
(MAO-A) gene (dubbed the "warrior gene"), encoding for the MAO-A enzyme that regulates neurotransmitter
activity by breaking down the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The polymorphism
associated with behavioral traits consists of 30 bases repeated between 2 and 5 times upstream of the MAO-A
gene, and produces comparatively less MAO-A enzyme. The 2R and 3R variants (linked to low MAO-A
activity) were found to vary widely in demographic prevalence among different ethnic groups. 5.5% of black
men and 0.1% of Caucasian men carry the 2R allele, whereas 59% of African-American men, 56% of Maori
men, 54% of Asian men, and 34% of Caucasian men carry the 3R variant.[95][96][97] Low MAO-A activity is
associated with a significantly increased risk of aggressive and antisocial behavior.[96][98][99][100]
Associations between a variation of the 5-HTTLPR region of the gene that encodes the serotonin transporter
and psychopathic traits have been found, and the gene has been suggested to be a significant factor in
psychopathy's aetiology.[101] 5-HTTLPR regulates the expression of the serotonin transporter on neuron
synapses, and is one of the most studied genetic polymorphisms, researched for its association with various
mental disorders.[102] The high activity "long" (L) allele of 5-HTTLPR, which increases the expression of the
serotonin transporter relative to the "short" (S), were found to be associated with PCL-R Factor 1 scores, or the
interpersonal-affective traits of psychopathy, which describes its core character disturbances (self-centeredness,
cold-heartedness).[101][103] The L allele is known to be associated with emotional resilience, reduced emotional
response to evocative situations, and a reduced risk of mood disorders.[104] A study on youths found that the L
homozygous allele correlated with psychopathic traits among those of a low socioeconomic background,
indicating a possible environmental influence on the expression of psychopathy.[105] Another study replicated
the association of the L homozygous allele and the interpersonal-affective psychopathic traits in men in a
correctional setting, but didn't find a connection between a history of abuse in childhood and such traits.[106] It
is theorized that reduced emotional and stress response that the L allele promotes may interact in a synergistic
manner with other gene variations that promote a reduced emotional response and a low sensitivity to distress to
predispose an individual to psychopathy.[107]

A study by Farrington of a sample of London males followed between age 8
and 48 included studying which factors scored 10 or more on the PCL:SV at
age 48. The strongest factors included having a convicted parent, being
physically neglected, low involvement of the father with the boy, low family
income, and coming from a disrupted family. Other significant factors
included poor supervision, harsh discipline, large family size, delinquent
sibling, young mother, depressed mother, low social class, and poor
housing.[108] There has also been association between psychopathy and
detrimental treatment by peers.[109] However, it is difficult to determine the
extent of an environmental influence on the development of psychopathy
because of evidence of its strong heritability.[110]
Brain injury
Researchers have linked head injuries with psychopathy and violence. Since
the 1980s, scientists have associated traumatic brain injury, such as damage to

similarities to diagnosed psychopathic individuals, displaying reduced
autonomic response to emotional stimuli, deficits in aversive conditioning,
similar preferences in moral and economic decision making, and diminished empathy and social emotions such
as guilt and shame.[111] These emotional and moral impairments may be especially severe when the brain injury
occurs at a young age. Children with early damage in the prefrontal cortex may never fully develop social or
moral reasoning and become "psychopathic individuals ... characterized by high levels of aggression and
antisocial behavior performed without guilt or empathy for their victims". Additionally, damage to the
amygdala may impair the ability of the prefrontal cortex to interpret feedback from the limbic system, which
could result in uninhibited signals that manifest in violent and aggressive behavior.[69][70][71][78]

Other theories
Primary and secondary
Psychopathy can emerge from an amalgamation of divergent factors. One conceptualization suggests two
dichotomous origins, termed primary and secondary psychopathy.[112] Using this model of research, these
different variants are believed to have distinct etiologies. Primary psychopathy arises from mostly genetically
driven factors, whereas environmental factors may play a stronger role in secondary psychopathy. Some
research suggests that secondary psychopathy is associated with higher levels of anxiety and greater
receptiveness to environmental stressors, while primary psychopathy is associated with low anxiety and greater
deficiency in fear response.[113] There is substantial evidence that anxiety can play a mediating role in many
psychopathologies, including psychopathy. However, there is insufficient evidence supporting the different
characteristic and etiological processes thought to underlie primary and secondary psychopathy at this time,
though some have been theorised.[114][115] It is also important to note that as psychopathy is considered
dimensional, not categorical, these variants may be considered prototypes of idealized individuals falling near
the mean of each variant, manifesting the most defining characteristics; i.e. individuals may not in reality be

distinctly one or the other.[2]
Evolutionary explanations
Psychopathy is associated with several adverse life outcomes as well as increased risk of disability and death
due to factors such as violence, accidents, homicides, and suicides. This, in combination with the evidence for
genetic influences, is evolutionarily puzzling and may suggest that there are compensating evolutionary
advantages, and researchers within evolutionary psychology have proposed several evolutionary explanations.
According to one hypothesis, some traits associated with psychopathy may be socially adaptive, and
psychopathy may be a frequency-dependent, socially parasitic strategy, which may work as long as there is a
large population of altruistic and trusting individuals, relative to the population of psychopathic individuals, to
be exploited.[94][116] It is also suggested that some traits associated with psychopathy such as early,
promiscuous, adulterous, and coercive sexuality may increase reproductive success.[94][116] Robert Hare has
stated that many psychopathic males have a pattern of mating with and quickly abandoning women, and thereby
have a high fertility rate, resulting in children that may inherit a predisposition to psychopathy.[2][109][117]
Criticism includes that it may be better to look at the contributing personality factors rather than treat
psychopathy as a unitary concept due to poor testability. Empirical evidence regarding the suggested
reproductive success is lacking.[2] Furthermore, if psychopathy is caused by the combined effects of a very
large number of adverse mutations then each mutation may have such a small an effect that it escapes natural
selection.[2][94] The personality is thought to be influenced by a very large number of genes and may be
disrupted by random mutations, and psychopathy may instead be a product of a high mutation load.[94]
Psychopathy has alternatively been suggested to be a spandrel, a byproduct, or side-effect, of the evolution of
adaptive traits rather than an adaptation in itself.[116][118]

Mechanisms
Psychological
Some laboratory research demonstrate correlations between psychopathy and atypical responses to aversive
stimuli, including weak conditioning to painful stimuli and poor learning of avoiding responses that cause
punishment, as well as low reactivity in the autonomic nervous system as measured with skin conductance
while waiting for a painful stimulus but not when the stimulus occurs. While it has been argued that the reward
system functions normally, some studies have also found reduced reactivity to pleasurable stimuli. According to
the response modulation hypothesis, psychopathic individuals have also had difficulty switching from an
ongoing action despite environmental cues signaling a need to do so.[119] This may explain the difficulty
responding to punishment, although it is unclear if it can explain findings such as deficient conditioning. There
may be methodological issues regarding the research.[2] While establishing a range of idiosyncrasies on average
in linguistic and affective processing under certain conditions, this research program has not confirmed a
common pathology of psychopathy.[120]

Neurological
Thanks to advancing MRI studies, experts are able to visualize specific brain differences and abnormalities of
individuals with psychopathy in areas that control emotions, social interactions, ethics, morality, regret,
impulsivity and conscience within the brain. Blair, a researcher who pioneered research into psychopathic
tendencies stated, “With regard to psychopathy, we have clear indications regarding why the pathology gives

the neural systems implicated in this pathology”.[78] Dadds et al., remarks
that despite a rapidly advancing neuroscience of empathy, little is known
about the developmental underpinnings of the psychopathic disconnect
between affective and cognitive empathy.[121]
A 2008 review by Weber et al. suggested that psychopathy is sometimes
associated with brain abnormalities in prefrontal-temporo-limbic regions
that are involved in emotional and learning processes, among others.[122]
Neuroimaging studies have found structural and functional differences
between those scoring high and low on the PCL-R in a 2011 review by
Dysfunction of the orbitofrontal
Skeem et al. stating that they are "most notably in the amygdala,
cortex, among other areas, is
hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri, anterior and posterior cingulate
implicated in the etiology of
cortex, striatum, insula, and frontal and temporal cortex".[2] A 2010
psychopathy.
meta-analysis found that antisocial, violent and psychopathic individuals
had reduced structure function in the right orbitofrontal cortex, right
anterior cingulate cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.[1] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles
/PMC2784035/)
The amygdala and frontal areas have been suggested as particularly important.[72] People scoring 25 or higher
in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear on average to have significantly reduced
microstructural integrity between the white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (such as
the uncinate fasciculus). The evidence suggested that the degree of abnormality was significantly related to the
degree of psychopathy and may explain the offending behaviors.[73] Furthermore, changes in the amygdala have
been associated with "callous-unemotional" traits in children. However, the amygdala has also been associated
with positive emotions, and there have been inconsistent results in the studies in particular areas, which may be
due to methodological issues.[2]
Some of these findings are consistent with other research and theories. For example, in a neuroimaging study of
how individuals with psychopathy respond to emotional words, widespread differences in activation patterns
have been shown across the temporal lobe when psychopathic criminals were compared to "normal" volunteers,
which is consistent with views in clinical psychology. Additionally, the notion of psychopathy being
characterized by low fear is consistent with findings of abnormalities in the amygdala, since deficits in aversive
conditioning and instrumental learning are thought to result from amygdala dysfunction, potentially
compounded by orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction, although the specific reasons are unknown.[78][123]
Proponents of the primary-secondary psychopathy distinction and triarchic model argue that there are
neurological differences between these subgroups of psychopathy which support their views. For instance, the
boldness factor in the triarchic model is argued to be associated with reduced activity in the amygdala during
fearful or aversive stimuli and reduced startle response, while the disinhibition factor is argued to be associated
with impairment of frontal lobe tasks. There is evidence that boldness and disinhibition are genetically
distinguishable.[2]

Biochemical
High levels of testosterone combined with low levels of cortisol and/or serotonin have been theorized as
contributing factors. Testosterone is "associated with approach-related behavior, reward sensitivity, and fear
reduction", and injecting testosterone "shift[s] the balance from punishment to reward sensitivity", decreases
fearfulness, and increases "responding to angry faces". Some studies have found that high testosterone levels

are associated with antisocial and aggressive behaviors, yet other research suggests that testosterone alone does
not cause aggression but increases dominance-seeking. It is unclear from studies if psychopathy correlates with
high testosterone levels, but a few studies have found psychopathy to be linked to low cortisol levels and
reactivity. Cortisol increases withdrawal behavior and sensitivity to punishment and aversive conditioning,
which are abnormally low in individuals with psychopathy and may underlie their impaired aversion learning
and disinhibited behavior. High testosterone levels combined with low serotonin levels are associated with
"impulsive and highly negative reactions", and may increase violent aggression when an individual is provoked
or becomes frustrated.[124] Several animal studies note the role of serotonergic functioning in impulsive
aggression and antisocial behavior.[125][126][127][128]
However, some studies on animal and human subjects have suggested that the emotional-interpersonal traits and
predatory aggression of psychopathy, in contrast to impulsive and reactive aggression, is related to increased
serotoninergic functioning.[101][129][130][131] A study by Dolan and Anderson on the relationship between
setotonin and psychopathic traits in a sample of personality disordered offenders, found that serotonin
functioning as measured by prolactin response, while inversely associated with impulsive and antisocial traits,
were positively correlated with arrogant and deceitful traits, and, to a lesser extent, callous and remorseless
traits.[132] Bariş Yildirim theorizes that the 5-HTTLPR "long" allele, which is generally regarded as protective
against internalizing disorders, may interact with other serotoninergic genes to create a hyper-regulation and
dampening of affective processes that results in psychopathy's emotional impairments.[107] Furthermore, the
combination of the 5-HTTLPR long allele and high testosterone levels has been found to result in a reduced
response to threat as measured by cortisol reactivity, which mirrors the fear deficits found in those afflicted with
psychopathy.[133]
Studies have suggested other correlations. Psychopathy was associated in two studies with an increased ratio of
HVA (a dopamine metabolite) to 5-HIAA (a serotonin metabolite).[124] Studies have found that individuals with
the traits meeting criteria for psychopathy show a greater dopamine response to potential "rewards" such as
monetary promises or taking drugs such as amphetamines. This has been theoretically linked to increased
impulsivity.[134] A 2010 British study found that a large 2D:4D digit ratio, an indication of high prenatal
estrogen exposure, was a "positive correlate of psychopathy in females, and a positive correlate of callous affect
(psychopathy sub-scale) in males".[135]
Findings have also shown monoamine oxidase A to affect the predictive ability of the PCL-R.[98] Monoamine
oxidases (MAOs) are enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and
dopamine and are, therefore, capable of influencing feelings, mood, and behavior in individuals.[136] Findings
suggest that further research is needed in this area.[137][138]

Diagnosis
Tools
Psychopathy Checklist
Psychopathy is most commonly assessed with the Psychopathy Checklist, Revised (PCL-R), created by Robert
D. Hare based on Cleckley's criteria from the 1940s, criminological concepts such as those of William and Joan
McCord, and his own research on criminals and incarcerated offenders in Canada.[74][139][140] The PCL-R is
widely used and is referred to by some as the "gold standard" for assessing psychopathy.[141] There are
nonetheless numerous criticisms of the PCL-R as a theoretical tool and in real-world usage.[142][143]

[144][145][146]

Each of the 20 items in the PCL-R is scored on a three-point scale, with a
rating of 0 if it does not apply at all, 1 if there is a partial match or mixed
information, and 2 if there is a reasonably good match to the offender.
Assessment is ideally done through face-to-face interviews together with
supporting information on subject history (e.g. from case files), but can also
be conducted using only on-file information. It can take up to three hours to
collect and review the information.[2][147] High PCL-R scores are
positively associated with measures of impulsivity and aggression,
Machiavellianism, and persistent criminal behavior, and are negatively
associated with measures of empathy and affiliation. Out of a maximum
score of 40, the cut-off for the label of psychopathy is 30 in the United
States and 25 in the United Kingdom.[2][148] A cut-off score of 25 is also
sometimes used for research purposes.[2]

The Psychopathy ChecklistRevised is the most widely used
assessment of psychopathy, and
can have important consequences
for the individuals assessed

Most of the PCL-R items are grouped into two categories, each measuring a
certain aspect of psychopathy. Factor 1 measures affective (emotion)
deficits and interpersonal traits and is associated with narcissism, reduced
empathy, boldness as well as reduced fear or depression. Factor 2 measures
impulsive, irresponsible and antisocial behaviors and is associated with a
maladaptive lifestyle including criminality. The two factors correlate with each other to some extent.[2] The
items "promiscuous sexual behavior" and "many short-term marital relationships" are not associated with either
factor.[147]
Because scores may have important consequences for an individual's future, there is a considerable potential for
harm if the checklist is used or administered incorrectly. Results can only be considered valid if the test is
administered by a suitably qualified and experienced clinician under controlled conditions.[147][149]
There are additional inventories derived directly from the PCL-R, including the Psychopathy Checklist:
Screening Version (PCL:SV) and Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV). The PCL:SV was developed
as a labor-saving assessment for the same forensic settings as the PCL-R and to meet the needs of settings
where clients do not necessarily have criminal records (e.g. civil psychiatric patients). The PCL:YV assesses
juvenile psychopathy in children and adolescents.[2]
Psychopathic Personality Inventory
Unlike the PCL, the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) was developed to comprehensively index
personality traits without explicitly referring to antisocial or criminal behaviors themselves. It is a self-report
scale that was developed originally for non-clinical samples (e.g. university students) rather than prisoners,
though may be used with the latter. It was revised in 2005 to become the PPI-R and now comprises 154 items
organized into eight subscales.[150] The item scores have been found to group into two overarching and largely
separate factors (unlike the PCL-R factors), Fearless-Dominance and Impulsive Antisociality, plus a third
factor, Coldheartedness, which is largely dependent on scores on the other two.[2] Factor 1 is associated with
social efficacy while Factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies. A person may score at different levels
on the different factors, but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic personality.[2]
DSM and ICD

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy

There are currently two widely established systems for classifying mental disorders—the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Both
list categories of disorders thought to be distinct types, and have deliberately converged their codes in recent
revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain.
The first edition of the DSM in 1952 had a section on sociopathic personality disturbances, then a general term
that included such things as homosexuality and alcoholism as well as an "antisocial reaction" and "dyssocial
reaction". The latter two eventually became antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in the DSM and dissocial
personality disorder in the ICD. Both manuals have stated that their diagnoses have been referred to, or include
what is referred to, as psychopathy or sociopathy, although neither diagnostic manual has ever included a
disorder officially titled as such.[2][4][5]
DSM
Antisocial personality disorder

Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), the criteria of which were based on American psychiatrist Hervey
Cleckley's work on psychopathy, is described in the DSM-IV-TR as "... a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and
violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.
This pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dissocial personality disorder".[4][5][151]
A diagnosis of ASPD is based largely on explicit behavioral patterns, whereas measurement tools such as the
PCL or PPI also largely, or solely, rely on judgment or self-reports of personality traits.[2][152][153] The
diagnostic criteria for ASPD focus relatively less on personality traits partly due to the belief that such traits are
difficult to measure reliably and it is "easier to agree on the behaviors that typify a disorder than on the reasons
why they occur".[152][153] As a result, critics have argued that psychopathy and ASPD are not synonymous,
despite the DSM's statement that ASPD has been referred to as psychopathy.[2][4][5][148][152][153]
Nonetheless, psychopathy has been proposed as a specifier under an alternative model for ASPD. In the
DSM-5, under "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders", ASPD with psychopathic features is
described as characterized by "a lack of anxiety or fear and by a bold interpersonal style that may mask
maladaptive behaviors (e.g., fraudulence)". Low levels of withdrawal and high levels of attention-seeking
combined with low anxiety are associated with "social potency" and "stress immunity" in psychopathy.[154]:765
Under the specifier, affective and interpersonal characteristics are comparatively emphasized over behavioral
components.[155]
ICD
Dissocial personality disorder

The ICD defines a conceptually similar or equivalent disorder to ASPD called dissocial personality disorder,
"usually coming to attention because of a gross disparity between behaviour and the prevailing social norms,
and characterized by" at least 3 of 6 specific issues. The manual states that its diagnosis includes "amoral,
antisocial, asocial, psychopathic, and sociopathic personality (disorder)".[6][156]

There are some traditional personality tests that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they assess
relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior. These include the Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory (Psychopathic Deviate scale), California Psychological Inventory
(Socialization scale), and Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory Antisocial Personality Disorder scale. There is
also the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP) and the Hare Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (HSRP),
but in terms of self-report tests, the PPI/PPI-R has become more used than either of these in modern
psychopathy research on adults.[2]

Comorbidity
As with other mental disorders, psychopathy as a personality disorder may be present with a variety of other
diagnosable conditions. Studies especially suggest strong comorbidity with antisocial personality disorder.
Among numerous studies, positive correlations have also been reported between psychopathy and histrionic,
narcissistic, borderline, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders, panic and obsessive–compulsive disorders,
but not neurotic disorders in general, schizophrenia, or depression.[41][157][158][159][160]
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is known to be highly comorbid with conduct disorder (a
theorized precursor to ASPD), and may also co-occur with psychopathic tendencies. This may be explained in
part by deficits in executive function.[157] Anxiety disorders often co-occur with ASPD, and contrary to
assumptions, psychopathy can sometimes be marked by anxiety; this appears to be related to items from Factor
2 but not Factor 1 of the PCL-R. Psychopathy is also associated with substance use disorders.[43][157]
[159][161][162]

It has been suggested that psychopathy may be comorbid with several other conditions than these,[162] but
limited work on comorbidity has been carried out. This may be partly due to difficulties in using inpatient
groups from certain institutions to assess comorbidity, owing to the likelihood of some bias in sample
selection.[157]

Further considerations
Primary and secondary variants
Several researchers have argued that there are two variants of psychopathy which share significant traits but
differ across several key dimensions. There is also empirical support for separating persons scoring high on the
PCL-R into two groups that do not simply reflect Factor 1 and Factor 2. There is at least preliminary evidence
of differences regarding cognition and affect as measured in laboratory tests. Nonetheless, as psychopathy is
considered dimensional, not categorical, these variants may be considered prototypes of idealized individuals
which fall near the mean of either variant, representing the most defining characteristics; i.e. in reality
individuals may not be categorically one or the other. Different theories characterize these two variants
somewhat differently.[2]
Compared to "primary" psychopathy, "secondary" psychopathy has been conceptualized as being associated
with more fear, anxiety, and other negative emotions. This subtype is seen as more impulsive and with more
reactive anger and aggression. David T. Lykken, using Gray's biopsychological theory of personality, argued
that primary psychopathy is characterized by little fear while secondary psychopathy is characterized by an
increased sensitivity to rewards.[2] Studies also suggest that secondary psychopathy manifests more features of
borderline personality than primary psychopathy, and comparable levels of antisocial behavior.[163]

11/30/2016 7:08 PM

Psychopathy - Wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy

There are also different theories as to the predominant causes of either variant. Some researchers, such as
Benjamin Karpman, believe that primary psychopathy is caused by an inherent emotional deficit and that
secondary psychopathy is acquired through adverse environmental experiences, although others, such as
Lykken, link both variants to biological predispositions.[2][115] Some preliminary research suggests that
secondary psychopathy may be associated with a more abusive childhood, a higher risk of future violence, and
potentially a better response to treatment.[2]
Sex differences
Research on psychopathy has largely been done on men and the PCL-R was developed using mainly male
criminal samples, raising the question of how well the results apply to women. Men score higher than women
on both the PCL-R and the PPI and on both of their main scales. The differences tend to be somewhat larger on
the interpersonal-affective scale than on the antisocial scale. Most but not all studies have found broadly similar
factor structure for men and women.[2]
Many associations with other personality traits are similar, although in one study the antisocial factor was more
strongly related with impulsivity in men and more strongly related with openness to experience in women. It
has been suggested that psychopathy in men manifest more as an antisocial pattern while in women it manifests
more as a histrionic pattern. Studies on this have shown mixed results. PCL-R scores may be somewhat less
predictive of violence and recidivism in women. On the other hand, psychopathy may have a stronger
relationship with suicide and possibly internalizing symptoms in women. A suggestion is that psychopathy
manifests more as externalizing behaviors in men and more as internalizing behaviors in women.[2]
Studies have also found that women in prison score significantly lower on psychopathy than men, with one
study reporting only 11 percent of violent females in prison met the psychopathy criteria in comparison to 31
percent of violent males.[164] Other studies have also pointed out that high psychopathic females are rare in
forensic settings.[165]

Management
Clinical
Psychopathy has often been considered untreatable. Its unique characteristics makes it among the most
refractory of personality disorders, a class of mental illnesses that are already traditionally considered difficult
to treat.[166][167] People afflicted with psychopathy are generally unmotivated to seek treatment for their
condition, and can be uncooperative in therapy.[141][166] Attempts to treat psychopathy with the current tools
available to psychiatry have been disappointing. Harris and Rice's Handbook of Psychopathy says that there is
currently little evidence for a cure or effective treatment for psychopathy; as of yet, no pharmacological
therapies are known to or have been trialed for alleviating the emotional, interpersonal and moral deficits of
psychopathy, and patients with psychopathy who undergo psychotherapy might gain the skills to become more
adept at the manipulation and deception of others and be more likely to commit crime.[168] Some studies
suggest that punishment and behavior modification techniques are ineffective at modifying the behavior of
psychopathic individuals as they are insensitive to punishment or threat.[168][169] These failures have led to a
widely pessimistic view on its treatment prospects, a view that is exacerbated by the little research being done
into this disorder compared to the efforts committed to other mental illnesses, which makes it more difficult to
gain the understanding of this condition that is necessary to develop effective therapies.[170][171]

Although the core character deficits of highly psychopathic individuals are likely to be highly incorrigible to the
currently available treatment methods, the antisocial and criminal behavior associated with it may be more
amenable to management, the management of which being the main aim of therapy programs in correctional
settings.[166] It has been suggested that the treatments that may be most likely to be effective at reducing overt
antisocial and criminal behavior are those that focus on self-interest, emphasizing the tangible, material value of
prosocial behavior, with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the patient wants out of life in prosocial
rather than antisocial ways.[172][173] To this end, various therapies have been tried with the aim of reducing the
criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy, with mixed success.[166] As psychopathic
individuals are insensitive to sanction, reward-based management, in which small privileges are granted in
exchange for good behavior, has been suggested and used to manage their behavior in institutional settings.[174]
Psychiatric medications may also alleviate co-occurring conditions sometimes associated with the disorder or
with symptoms such as aggression or impulsivity, including antipsychotic, antidepressant or mood-stabilizing
medications, although none have yet been approved by the FDA for this purpose.[2][4][5][155][175] For example, a
study found that the antipsychotic clozapine may be effective in reducing various behavioral dysfunctions in a
sample of high-security hospital inpatients with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathic traits.[176]
However, research into the pharmacological treatment of psychopathy and the related condition antisocial
personality disorder is minimal, with much of the knowledge in this area being extrapolations based on what is
known about pharmacology in other mental disorders.[166][177]

Legal
The PCL-R, the PCL:SV, and the PCL:YV are highly regarded and widely used in criminal justice settings,
particularly in North America. They may be used for risk assessment and for assessing treatment potential and
be used as part of the decisions regarding bail, sentence, which prison to use, parole, and regarding whether a
youth should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult. There have been several criticisms against its use in legal
settings. They include the general criticisms against the PCL-R, the availability of other risk assessment tools
which may have advantages, and the excessive pessimism surrounding the prognosis and treatment possibilities
of those who are diagnosed with psychopathy.[2]
The interrater reliability of the PCL-R can be high when used carefully in research but tend to be poor in
applied settings. In particular Factor 1 items are somewhat subjective. In sexually violent predator cases the
PCL-R scores given by prosecution experts were consistently higher than those given by defense experts in one
study. The scoring may also be influenced by other differences between raters. In one study it was estimated
that of the PCL-R variance, about 45% was due to true offender differences, 20% was due to which side the
rater testified for, and 30% was due to other rater differences.[2]
To aid a criminal investigation, certain interrogation approaches may be used to exploit and leverage the
personality traits of suspects thought to have psychopathy and make them more likely to divulge
information.[178]
United Kingdom
The PCL-R cut-off for a label of psychopathy is 25 in the United Kingdom, instead of 30 as it is in the United
States.[2][148]
In the United Kingdom, "psychopathic disorder" was legally defined in the Mental Health Act (UK), under
MHA1983,[148][179] as "a persistent disorder or disability of mind (whether or not including significant

11/30/2016 7:08 PM

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy

impairment of intelligence) which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the
part of the person concerned". This term was intended to reflect the presence of a personality disorder in terms
of conditions for detention under the Mental Health Act 1983. Amendments to MHA1983 within the Mental
Health Act 2007 abolished the term "psychopathic disorder", with all conditions for detention (e.g. mental
illness, personality disorder, etc.) encompassed by the generic term of "mental disorder".[180]
In England and Wales, the diagnosis of dissocial personality disorder is grounds for detention in secure
psychiatric hospitals under the Mental Health Act if they have committed serious crimes, but since such
individuals are disruptive to other patients and not responsive to usual treatment methods this alternative to
traditional incarceration is often not used.[181]
United States
"Sexual psychopath" laws

Starting in the 1930s, before some modern concepts of psychopathy were developed, "sexual psychopath" laws,
the term referring broadly to mental illness, were introduced by some states, and by the mid-1960s more than
half of the states had such laws. Sexual offenses were considered to be caused by underlying mental illnesses,
and it was thought that sex offenders should be treated, in agreement with the general rehabilitative trends at
this time. Courts committed sex offenders to a mental health facility for community protection and treatment.
[182][183][184]

Starting in 1970, many of these laws were modified or abolished in favor of more traditional responses such as
imprisonment due to criticism of the "sexual psychopath" concept as lacking scientific evidence, the treatment
being ineffective, and predictions of future offending being dubious. There were also a series of cases where
persons treated and released committed new sexual offenses. Starting in the 1990s, several states have passed
sexually dangerous person laws, including registration, housing restrictions, public notification, mandatory
reporting by health care professionals, and civil commitment, which permits indefinite confinement after a
sentence has been completed.[184] Psychopathy measurements may be used in the confinement decision
process.[2]

Prognosis
The prognosis for psychopathy in forensic and clinical settings is quite poor, with some studies reporting that
treatment may worsen the antisocial aspects of psychopathy as measured by recidivism rates, though it is noted
that one of the frequently cited studies finding increased criminal recidivism after treatment, a 2011
retrospective study of a treatment program in the 1960s, had several serious methodological problems and likely
would not be approved of today.[2][141] However, some relatively rigorous quasi-experimental studies using
more modern treatment methods have found improvements regarding reducing future violent and other criminal
behavior, regardless of PCL-R scores, although none were randomized controlled trials. Various other studies
have found improvements in risk factors for crime such as substance abuse. No study has of yet in a 2013
review examined if the personality traits that form the core character disturbances of psychopathy could be
changed by such treatments.[2][185]

Epidemiology
A 2008 study using the PCL:SV found that 1.2% of a US sample scored 13 or more out of 24, indicating

11/30/2016 7:08 PM

Psychopathy - Wikipedia

22 of 38

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy

"potential psychopathy". The scores correlated significantly with violence, alcohol use, and lower
intelligence.[43] A 2009 British study by Coid et al., also using the PCL:SV, reported a community prevalence
of 0.6% scoring 13 or more. The scores correlated with younger age, male gender, suicide attempts, violence,
imprisonment, homelessness, drug dependence, personality disorders (histrionic, borderline and antisocial), and
panic and obsessive–compulsive disorders.[186]
Psychopathy has a much higher prevalence in the convicted and incarcerated population, where it is thought that
an estimated 15–25% of prisoners qualify for the diagnosis.[76] A study on a sample of inmates in the UK found
that 7.7% of the inmates interviewed met the PCL-R cut-off of 30 for a diagnosis of psychopathy.[41] A study on
a sample of inmates in Iran using the PCL:SV found a prevalence of 23% scoring 18 or more.[187]

Society and culture
In the workplace
There is limited research on psychopathy in the general work populace, in part because the PCL-R includes
antisocial behavior as a significant core factor (obtaining a PCL-R score above the threshold is unlikely without
having significant scores on the antisocial-lifestyle factor) and does not include positive adjustment
characteristics, and most researchers have studied psychopathy in incarcerated criminals, a relatively accessible
population of research subjects.[188] However, psychologists Fritzon and Board, in their study comparing the
incidence of personality disorders in business executives against criminals detained in a mental hospital, found
that the profiles of some senior business managers contained significant elements of personality disorders,
including those referred to as the "emotional components", or interpersonal-affective traits, of psychopathy.
Factors such as boldness, low disinhibition, and meanness as defined in the triarchic model, in combination with
other advantages such as a favorable upbringing and high intelligence, are thought to correlate with stress
immunity and stability, and may contribute to this particular expression.[188] Such individuals are sometimes
referred to as "successful psychopaths" or "corporate psychopaths" (among other synonyms), and may not
necessarily aways have extensive histories of traditional criminal or antisocial behavior as characteristic of the
traditional conceptualization of psychopathy.[62] Robert Hare claims that the prevalence of psychopathic traits is
higher in the business world than in the general population, reporting that while about 1% of the general
population meet the clinical criteria for psychopathy, figures of around 3-4% have been cited for more senior
positions in business.[2][189][190]
Academics on this subject believe that although psychopathy is manifested in only a small percentage of
workplace staff, it is more common at higher levels of corporate organizations, and its negative effects (for
example, increased bullying, conflict, stress, staff turnover, absenteeism, reduction in productivity) often causes
a ripple effect throughout an organization, setting the tone for an entire corporate culture. Employees with the
disorder are self-serving opportunists, and may disadvantage their own organizations to further their own
interests.[191] They may be charming to staff above his/her level in the workplace hierarchy, aiding their ascent
through the organization, but abusive to staff below his/her level, and can do enormous damage when they are
positioned in senior management roles.[192][193] Psychopathy as measured by the PCL-R is associated with
lower performance appraisals among corporate professionals.[194] The psychologist Oliver James identifies
psychopathy as one of the dark triadic traits in the workplace, the others being narcissism and
Machiavellianism, which, like psychopathy, can have negative consequences.[195]
Hare considers newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell to have been a strong candidate as a "corporate
psychopath".[196]

In fiction
Characters with psychopathy or sociopathy are some of the most notorious characters in film and literature, but
their characterizations may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of psychopathy as it is defined in
psychiatry, criminology, and research. The character may be identified as having psychopathy within the
fictional work itself, by its creators, or from the opinions of audiences and critics, and may be based on
undefined popular stereotypes of psychopathy.[197]
Such characters are often portrayed in an exaggerated fashion and typically in the role of a villain or antihero,
where the general characteristics and stereotypes associated with psychopathy are useful to facilitate conflict
and danger. Because the definitions, criteria, and popular conceptions throughout its history have varied over
the years and continue to change even now, many of the characters characterized as psychopathic in notable
works at the time of publication may no longer fit the current definition and conception of psychopathy. There
are several archetypal images of psychopathy in both lay and professional accounts which only partly overlap
and can involve contradictory traits: the charming con artist, the deranged serial killer and mass murderer, the
callous and scheming businessperson, and the chronic low-level offender and juvenile delinquent. The public
concept reflects some combination of fear of a mythical bogeyman, the disgust and intrigue surrounding evil,
and fascination and sometimes perhaps envy of people who might appear to go through life without attachments
and unencumbered by guilt, anguish or insecurity.[2]

History
Etymology
The word psychopathy is a joining of the Greek words psyche (ψυχή) "soul" and pathos (πάθος) "suffering,
feeling".[198] The first documented use is from 1847 in Germany as psychopatisch,[199] and the noun
psychopath has been traced to 1885.[200] In medicine, patho- has a more specific meaning of disease (thus
pathology has meant the study of disease since 1610, and psychopathology has meant the study of mental
disorder in general since 1847. A sense of "a subject of pathology, morbid, excessive" is attested from
1845,[201] including the phrase pathological liar from 2077 in the medical literature).
The term psychopathy initially had a very general meaning referring to all sorts of mental disorders and social
aberrations, popularised from 1891 in Germany by Koch's concept of "psychopathic inferiority"
(psychopathische Minderwertigkeiten). Some medical dictionaries still define psychopathy in both a narrow and
broad sense, such as MedlinePlus from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.[202] On the other hand,
Stedman's Medical Dictionary defines psychopathy only as an outdated term for an antisocial type of
personality disorder.[203]
The term psychosis was also used in Germany from 1841, originally in a very general sense. The suffix -ωσις
(-osis) meant in this case "abnormal condition". This term or its adjective psychotic would come to refer to the
more severe mental disturbances and then specifically to mental states or disorders characterized by
hallucinations, delusions or in some other sense markedly out of touch with reality.[204]
The slang term psycho has been traced to a shortening of the adjective psychopathic from 1936, and from 1942
as a shortening of the noun psychopath,[205] but it is also used as shorthand for psychotic or crazed.[206]
The label psychopath has been described as nonspecific but probably persisting because it indicates that the
source of behavior lies in the psyche rather than in the situation. The media usually uses the term to designate

any criminal whose offenses are particularly abhorrent and unnatural, but that is not its original or general
psychiatric meaning.[207]
Sociopathy
The word element socio has been used in compound words since around 1880.[208][209] The term sociopathy
may have been first introduced in 1909 in Germany by biological psychiatrist Karl Birnbaum and in 1930 in the
US by educational psychologist George E. Partridge, as an alternative to the concept of psychopathy.[208] It was
used to indicate that the defining feature is violation of social norms, or antisocial behavior, and has often also
been associated with postulating social as well as biological causation.[210][211][212][213]
There are various contemporary usages of the term. Robert Hare stated in the popular science book entitled
Snakes in Suits that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, but in some cases the term
sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas in
other cases the two terms may be used with different meanings that reflect the user's views on the origins and
determinants of the disorder. Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes
as due to social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that
there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors.[109] Hare
also provides his own definitions: he describes psychopathy as not having a sense of empathy or morality, but
sociopathy as only differing in sense of right and wrong from the average person.[214][215]

Precursors
The concept of psychopathy has been indirectly connected to the early 19th century with the work of Pinel
(1801; "mania without delirium") and Pritchard (1835; "moral insanity"), although historians have largely
discredited the idea of a direct equivalence.[216] Psychopathy originally described any illness of the mind, but
found its application to a narrow subset of mental conditions when was used toward the end of the 19th century
by the German psychiatrist Julius Koch (1891) to describe various behavioral and moral dysfunction in the
absence of an obvious mental illness or intellectual disability. He applied the term psychopathic inferiority
(psychopathischen Minderwertigkeiten) to various chronic conditions and character disorders, and his work
would influence the later conception of the personality disorder.[2][217]
The term psychopathic came to be used to describe a diverse range of dysfunctional or antisocial behavior and
mental and sexual deviances, including at the time homosexuality. It was often used to imply an underlying
"constitutional" or genetic origin. Disparate early descriptions likely set the stage for modern controversies
about the definition of psychopathy.[2]

20th century
An influential figure in shaping modern American conceptualizations of psychopathy was American
psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley. In his classic monograph, The Mask of Sanity (1941), Cleckley drew on a small
series of vivid case studies of psychiatric patients at a Veterans Administration hospital in Georgia to describe
the disorder. Cleckley used the metaphor of the "mask" to refer to the tendency of psychopaths to appear
confident, personable, and well-adjusted compared to most psychiatric patients, while revealing underlying
pathology through their actions over time. Cleckley formulated sixteen criteria to describe the disorder.[2] The
Scottish psychiatrist David Henderson had also been influential in Europe from 1939 in narrowing the
diagnosis.[219]

The diagnostic category of sociopathic personality in early editions of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)[151] had some key similarities to
Cleckley's ideas, though in 1980 when renamed Antisocial Personality
Disorder some of the underlying personality assumptions were removed.[4] In
1980, Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare introduced an alternative
measure, the "Psychopathy Checklist" (PCL) based largely on Cleckley's
criteria, which was revised in 1991 (PCL-R),[147] and is the most widely used
measure of psychopathy.[220] There are also several self-report tests, with the
Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) used more often among these in
contemporary adult research.[2]
Famous individuals have sometimes been diagnosed, albeit at a distance, as
psychopaths. As one example out of many possible from history, in a 1972
version of a secret report originally prepared for the Office of Strategic
Services in 1943, and which may have been intended to be used as
Psychoanalyst Walter C.
[221][222]
Langer described Adolf Hitler
propaganda,
non-medical psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer suggested
[218]
as a "neurotic
Adolf Hitler was probably a psychopath.
However, others have not drawn
psychopath".[218]
this conclusion; clinical forensic psychologist Glenn Walters argues that
Hitler's actions do not warrant a diagnosis of psychopathy as, although he
showed several characteristics of criminality, he was not always egocentric,
callously disregarding of feelings or lacking impulse control, and there is no proof he couldn't learn from
mistakes.[223]

A group of audio DAW plug-ins targeting Windows (VST), Mac (VST/AU), and Linux, mostly for Guitar
Amplifier simulation, with the C-120 being the flagship product (which started off long ago as a closedsource VST). Open source, mostly under GPL.
ScorchCrafter Guitar FX DAW Plug-ins Web Site ›

Sound/Audio (/directory/audio-video/sound/)

GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)
(/directory/license:gplv3/)

Up to 128-bit (internal) Multi-Stage Guitar Amplifier Layered Distortion, also runs in 64 and 32 bit
modes
Native Mac and Linux ports coming soon
Advanced maths for tube-like guitar amplifier distortion, doesn't use cheap waveshaping
Designed with dynamic response that changes according to the input level
--- Much more than just a basic "sample in, sample out"
Up to 12x Internal Oversampling, seperate controls for live/online and off-line render
Multi-Band EQ - low, mid, high, contour, presence
Built-in custom convolution-based cab-mic effect, works with almost any sample rate and/or audio
buffer size
New version of C120 has less clutter in GUI, separate page for advanced features
No commercial bloat!
GPL license, but just for the plug-in itself
Any rendered/processed audio is YOURS (any license you want)!
Hand-Coded in C++, pre-fab code or "wizards" were NOT used to build this!
Primarily built with MinGW-w64 and Code::Blocks IDE
NEW Jykwrakker plugin also features custom stereo reverb FX you won't find elsewhere.

Awesome indeed. Sorry for posting this here but the scorchcrafter Forum is not accessible: I couldn't find
the Visual Express projects for the amplifier sim in the svn trunk, may I ask for advice? Thank you!

New Development Snapshot version 5.3.2.0
This new version is nearly done, here's a preview RC development version for
all
of you to play with. For the most part it is stable, though it needs a tad
little
bit of polishing here and there, but for those of you who have been waiting so
long
for a new version, you can go ahead and download this one NOW and have some
fun with it.
The tube "grit" code has been totally overhauled, sounds much better and more
tube-like IMO,
and the plugin now includes a custom stereo reberb FX component, one which I
think already sounds
rather nice and unlike any other reberb effect out there that I've heard.
(Regardless, if you really
don't want it enabled you can easily switch it off in the GUI.)
Source code (and a final new release version) will come out once I polish some
stuff here and there
and make sure final bugs are ironed out.
I reduced oversampling settings to just three possible rate multipliers, as
with the new effect engine
the plug-in was taking up way too much RAM with internal copies of everything
for numerous sample rates.
You can now choose between 2x, 5x, and 12x oversampling, as well as how the
filters are applied (on the
third settings screen).
As before, on-screen hints are provided and I won't bother to write out a
seperate instruction manual.
(If you want to know who is responsible for why I have to do it this way, look

in the mirror - Why
should I write out a manual everyone will refuse to read, so they can email me
dumb questions when it
isn't my fault that they didn't read up on how the software works?)
Also as usual, this plugin was written with a direct-into-the-amp setup in
mind, I don't use a
tubescreamer. Of course you can use it however you want, I won't bother going
any further with that...
(If you can read this, you must have a lot of time on your hands, going this
far into a readme.txt when
you could be playing something on your guitar... Hmmmm...)
Okay, enjoy, ROCK ON, and in the meantime I'll try to get a working forum back
up...
--------------------------------------------------------New Release for 2014!
The "Jykwrakker" is the lastest software plug-in, everything else is OLD.
Current latest version is 5.2.4.0.
This release version for these plug-ins is built from SVN repo commit 200, so
if you want to re-build an exact
copy with the exact same code, revision 200 is what you want to check out.
(The fact it lands on an even number is pure coincidence and really has no
special meaning.)
Hint: In the GUI, use the upper-right corner buttons to flip through the
control screens and different options
(There are four screens with various controls). See those little squares?
Those are control buttons, and yes,
you click on those with the mouse! 'Nuff said, you should be able to figure
out the rest from there.
TUBESCREAMER USERS PLEASE NOTE that I did not design or test these plug-ins
with any pedal or other FX in
front of them. I built this software for a direct-into-the-amp type of
sound. Of course you can use them
however you like, I won't force you, but using a TS or other pedal or
pre-amp on front can give different
results which can really vary. My advice is to START with nothing in front
of the plug-in in your FX chain,
and THEN do some tweaking where you add things as needed.
NOTE that the Jykwrakker does NOT include a cab/mic sim or effect at this
time, so unless you are doing something
unusual (or happen to be Trent Reznor / Nine Inch Nails), you will need a
seperate plugin after the amp effect
using convolution or some other kind of speaker cab/mic effect on the audio
output for proper sound.

some of my computers - I mostly use Ubuntu,

the VST SDK (which can be compiled for Linux, I use
the 2.4 revision 2 version currently).
This is actually an area where I could really use some
help and feedback - I do happen to use Linux on
Kubuntu, and Xubuntu - and I really would like to
have a port that runs well in Ardour without any
need for Wine, "wrappers," etc., but I've never
programmed an audio plug-in for Linux before and
I'm not sure which SDK would be the best.
I will say that I have compiled some programs under
Linux before, so I'm not a total stranger to makeﬁles
and build scripts, and I'm comfortable with the
command line.
With regards to the source code, the SC source code
itself (without the VST SDK and VSTGUI SDK) does
NOT use any Microsoft-speciﬁc stuﬀ that I know of,
so if it was used with an SDK built for Linux it
shouldn't really need much in the way of changes to
be compiled for Linux. It does NOT depend on any
speciﬁc libraries that are only in Windows. The SDKs
used are a diﬀerent story though, and again that's
where I could use some help, in deciding with what
Linux-friendly implementation to go with.
I'd appreciate any info from anyone here who could
advise me as to what would be best for a Linux port.
I already have two other devs on board who work
with the Mac platform, but right now I'm still looking
for help on the Linux side.
BTW, I also have plans for a stand-alone product, not
a plug-in, and some other FX as well, (I'm also
researching convolution stuﬀ for speaker/cab
emulation).

Well two diﬀerent topics to cover here...
Posts:

Yes you are correct int hat VSTs can be natively
compiled for Linux. However that being said, if you
are targetting Ardour speciﬁcally, Ardour does not
natively support Linux VSTs. The LADSPA and LV2
plugin standards are by far the most common, with
LADSPA being the most common and best
established, and LV2 replacing it slowly. The catch to
LV2 is that it is very expandable, and there are
extensions in common use(External UI is a popular
one that is solved through extensions) on multiple
programs. So this can be a blessing and a curse at
the same time, the blessing being that it is easy to
extend LV2 to cover your use case, but the curse
being that software has to support it. Thus far I
would say the most successfully extensions probably
are those that were also supported in
Ardour(Typically people submitted patches to Ardour
to support them).
However if you don't need an extension, then don't
make one please. It does make things more
confusing;)
That being said, the main reason that VSTs are not
supported in Ardour to my knowledge are twofold.
There isn't much reason to with LADSPA and LV2 on
Linux is a big one(There are some native VSTs, but
the LADSPA oﬀerings are typically more popular on
Linux), and that noone has submitted patches(And
possibly been willing to support them) to do it is
another one. Paul can jump in here and correct me
on this when he gets back most likely;)
Now in as far as a standalone application, that is
where you will ﬁnd that Linux shines. Jack is all you
need, and you will be able to be routed into most
pro-audio programs on Linux, as Jack is the standard
for this on Linux. It also is fairly easy to develop for,
provided you are using a callback based audio
processing. If you are using a push based, it might be
more diﬃcult, but I haven't ever tried that.

the the sourceforge page of Scrochcrafter
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/scorchcrafter/).
Also mentioned in the text: "A group of audio DAW
plug-ins targeting Windows (VST), Mac (VST/AU), and
Linux, mostly for Guitar Ampliﬁer simulation."
However, I struggle to ﬁnd the linux ﬁles there... .
Does anyone have some more information about
this?
Also, some arguments above disapprove porting to
native linux VST because of the lack of VST support.
At the time I guess there was no VST host
implemented in Ardour yet. This is not the case
anymore, Ardour handles native VST plugins very
well today.

It should be only the GUI-part that is Windows-code

I've also included one photo of a demo instrument (I have many more available), this guitar was originally

The String King : Custom guitar restorations and construction

1 of 1

http://stringkinglutherie.com/

welcome to

The String King
String King has been a Full Service lutherie shop in northeast Ohio
repairing guitars and basses along with mandolins, banjos and
violins since 1989.
Offering minor repairs to refinishes and restorations (such as
binding, inlay, bracing or filling routes to name a few ) custom
conversions (such as making a righty a lefty) and custom electronics.
Also available handmade acoustic guitars, arch tops and hand shaped
Tremcaster solid body electrics.
String King is factory approved by Alvarez, Ovation and Dillion and
is the only factory approved Gibson Level A shop in Northern Ohio.
As you view the gallery you'll see that roughly half of the refins and
restorations shown are vintage Gibson and Fender plus others such
as Guild and Gretsch. Also included are a few photos of the flat tops
and arch tops that I've made, as well as photos of the Tremcaster
electrics. (For ordering info and pricing go to Tremcaster.com)
Be sure to take your time viewing the gallery and please call or write
with any questions. Keep in mind that if you don't see it that doesn't
mean that it can't be done! The gallery photos are just a sampling of
the repairs or restorations that I've done over the last twenty plus
years in business. If you would like references please don't hesitate
to ask.
Thank you for your interest and I hope to hear from you.
Sincerely
John Mosconi
