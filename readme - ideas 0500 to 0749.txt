Much talk from this forum, one of 1908 posts, including intellectual talks about - theoretical alien speicies, how a hypothetical sentient species evolves on various worlds and resulting characterisitcs, astronomy, serious-minded UFOs and exosolar life that has intelligent and educated non-conspiracy-theory scientific discussions as well as silly and shortsighted ignorant ultra-religious 'quick-and-snappy' paranoid rejection of alien life combined with tin foil hat psychotic talk and other discussions inbetween such, hard sci-fi and soft-sci-fi, intelligent talk as well as Chris-Sandusky-style-logic and what a 'wordoid' is, what a 'freshy' is [slang term, used in Antarctic historical species colonies where such live and such populations also go to [public] school and have local banks and convenience stores] etc, possible references to why some Antarctic human towns that have scientists seem to have an intelligent and clear-headed and non-infected understanding of global climate change and how dangerous funny-looking colored clouds in the sky are yet also 'mail-order' very large supplies of condoms for the six-month winters [believe it or not, there IS a casual, logical relationship between these two concepts, amid crackpot humor], and other stuff... -:

Idea #0547:
	I have wanted to save all of the human species.  This includes both genders and all ethnicities which is almost 8,000,000,000 (eight billion) people worldwide.  Everyone was going to have a fair chance and have pleasure and lives worth living without being victimized by anything and having an easy life where they wouldn't have to worry about working hard or health issues or growing old or disability or being out of work or finding any work or being in any sort of jail or prison and having pleasure their entire life without getting worn out or sick or old.  That and none of them would be beneath anyone else and and everyone would have these things just as much as everyone else and no one would be left out or inferior to anyone else regardless of gender or ethnic background or skin color or what culture they have and all cultures would have this worldwide.  'Blacks' as they call themselves referring to African-Americans in the USA really messed it up and demanded that they bully me and victimize me and insisted on refusing to have these things as I was trying to offer them and didn't want to have what I was trying to give them so that they would have a home and not be hated or considered too dangerous by the rest of the universe and anyone else including planet Earth itself.  They insisted and demanded to push for their own agenda where I would supposedly be their victim and their pet.  I was not racist and still am not racist and I was also never sexist and this is all still true and honest now.  They also demanded that I pretend to be racist and sexist and play their games and such and fall for their deceptions and tricks and be victimized by them.  I tried to work out an agreement where they would have a place to go when they would die and I did these things when no one would want them in any world and in any afterlife.  This is really sick seeing how they demand I plan with them and not with any others and now they are paying more and more of a price for this and are looking at a future where they will still have many of these things but will be pets and playthings of zarakites and dragon sky boys that they must trust and hope are nice and caring and compassionate to as well as fair to in many ways and trust is important as dragon sky boys will be the judges and will be in charge and will also decide if zarakites and dragon sky boys are being fair or not and blacks and other humans do not get to decide or judge these things and their own human teams and telepathic operators knew this and had this information for a very long time and knew it was true and shared it amongst themselves back and forth for years.  They [humans who are African Americans and have likewise skin color wherever they are from and whatever continent] are lucky I still want to give them this future or at least something close to it.  They are also lucky that I still don't care if they are old or ugly or disabled as humans as I have long planned repeatedly to fix that so that they don't have to worry about being 'fat and old but I can't help it this is just how I am' because zarakites and other dragon sky boys would take care of that and fix that FOR THEM one way or another and I have pushed for this repeatedly.  African American teams and operators and telepaths also dragged in others outside the USA repeatedly and had themselves gang up on me and bully me repeatedly while still harboring secret agendas.  They also knew that I am not trying to offer any telepathic or psychic lifestyle of any sort and I am going to give something real life whatever it is that does not involve holograms or illusions or telepathic dreams or delusions but instead the real thing where they experience it wide awake and fully alert and not part of any mass permanant delusion where people think they are any other species or have telepathic wings or cartoon wings or anything.  They blew it and they really could have had a lot more than what they are looking at now and I think they have done more than enough as such.  I just hope that females and women don't do more of the same thing and make the same mistakes.  They shouldn't and they really should trust me and not bully me.  If they [aforementioned humans] bully me then that hurts everyone and they are hated and punished by everyone left and right including their own which has already demonstrated itself and it isn't my fault or my doing but their fault and they alone are guilty and responsible for such and I am still innocent and this is just true as well as honest and real.  If they are nice to me and allow me to plan with how I want as well as give me positive treatment and give me what I actually ask for and actually want without playing dumb and without bullying me they don't get punished and they have more to look forward to and in the past they would get rewarded for such and right now I don't know how much of that they will get as they have really gone too far and made very bad choices.  They have overall been too d--n evil and do NOT have any that will look like heros in the end to ANY in ANY AFTERMATH not even in any secret way in the end and this is already their legacy and their future that they have already made real and unchangeable and they have gone too far as such and it has been THEIR FAULT and I am still completely innocent regarding these things and I tried to stop them from going too far and I had no ability to stop them and no skill and no empowerment to stop them either and this is all literally true and literally honest and literally real.  They should not have blocked and stalled my planning and they should not have been preventing me from planning with whom I wanted to and they should not have been trying to make me plan with any CIA or make everything into a military or spy agency project.  That was a huge mistake and the damage has been done and now things are moving out of anything any spy agency or CIA or military is going to manage or be in charge of or plan or be allowed or able to do as such.  I'm honestly not sure how bad the damage has been although they have dragged down many other humans with them including women of many different skin colors and cultures and ethinicities as well as hispanics and various other people left and right including even what's left of Native Americans and Aboriginees and obscure tribes in rain forests and other cultural groups I've never heard of including weird seceret societies I'm not familiar with and also didn't know exist and still don't know or understand and don't want to know or become familiar with.  Sky children are certainly going to be second-rate citizens and not be like any other sky boys and humans and hybrids and ancients etc and-or whatever are going to be with the sky children or close to it or beneath them with the way things look now although I'm still trying to work out the details and would be lying of course if I claimed I had all the answers and everything finished and everything supposedly worked out by now.  In the meantime I can't plan with the wrong groups or any agency or organization that will not allow these things to proceed properly or bully me or expect me to be a marine or soldier or police officer or military professional of any sort as that is nothing but a disaster and doesn't allow anything to work really.  There has been more than enough cumulative evidence in huge piles that is more than convincing enough for senators and presidents and law-makers and military officials of not just the USA but all nations on Earth and all continents to verify and fully convince that these things are all true and all honest as well as real just the same.  That and my 'perks' as they are sometimes called are actually essential and part of what I plan with and accomplish working planning and communications and such with that can actually get any approval as well as be presented properly and be understood as they should and get past any miscommunications and also past what I have been planning to save so many from.  I'm trying to plan to accomplish multiple goals of course and this is no secret and isn't anything I was trying to make a secret either.

Idea #0586:
	Paul Samuel Reeves and Martin Eric Reeves were both always into spy movies and would read spy novels by Tom Clancy etc and Paul Samuel Reeves was also into James Bond.  [By coincidence perhaps Jennifer 'Jenny' Hartline was also into James Bond].  Paul S Reeves was expecially into the Sean Connery James Bond but others as well not to mention Doctor Who episodes especially Tom Baker.  Paul S Reeves would criticise James Bond movies at times yet still watch them and be a big fan of them as he and I would both watch a James Bond movie on VHS and he would talk about what secret agent James Bond with the British Secret Service or whatever would talk about secret missions and stuff while sitting at bars and restauraunts and also gambing casinos and stuff and Paul would say 'a real life secret agent wouldn't do that' or 'spies don't actually do that' etc and seemed to be quite well versed on how such things work in real life although I never actually asked him how or where he learned that type of information and never had the beginnings of any logic or thought process to start to lead to coming up with such questions [muddling?  ...as in 'Whoa!  Hey, you never wear cosmetic contact lenses and it's not even Halloween!  Where did you get those?  And you never wear sunglasses that are wrap-arounds.....  Not yet at least although I know you're diabetic and don't normally..... uh..... forget or whatever *cough*..... oops.....  BTW does anyone notice that even now there's no red dot on the back of my neck or any sniper's bullet coming in through the window right now?  Same s--- as in North Olmsted?  What's their policy on non-humans of various sorts anyways? [?]].  I remember when Paul S Reeves and I both watched 'Point Of No Return' with Bridget Fonda and near the end some 'cleaner' killed a guy with a car while waiting for the rookie secret agent [who they made out of what used to be a criminal and drug junkie etc yikes talk about dark hearted ideas and methods] and Paul was complained and whining repeatedly '...but he shouldn't do that!  A real actual secret agent WOULDN'T DO that!  A real spy wouldn't just kill a guy like that!  Not that way!' etc while we were watching the film and recording it on VHS off of pay-per-view.  I never wondered 'how would you know?' although if I had it would probably be from all of the James Bond and other spy novel books and stuff he was into during days when he was in grade school and beyond etc.  He was also into camping and boy scouts and flashlights that bend at a ninety-degree angle at the end with the light and an expert on all that like he had an ecyclopedia in his head yet without being an Asperger like a human would to know that stuff while that young.  Go figure.  He seemed to also know a lot about theories and concepts of time travel and time and space and how human scientists had a flawed theory of gravity that he complained about while condescending them and what they put in univeristy textbooks and he would be really condescending to the human species and get arrogant and full of himself when he would talk like that and clearly not talk about the human species as if he were one of them.  [So much for being non-stop 'undercover' for decades and making it flawless.  Once in a while he would trip up.]  That and he was really into string theory and alternate realities and psychic stuff as well and would excitedly get into conversations easily and enthusiastically about that type of stuff and it was waaaaay over my head and know-how and that of any human being and any human with a PHD who he'd put to shame quite easily and seemed quite proud of and easily full of himself over.  [He apparently could only fake a human personality for so long before becoming frustrated and even then came off as a real weirdo in school among classmates and stuff and humans would complain about him and how much of a weird guy he was and how harsh and uptight he was over the years and would love to correct and discredit and belittle others left and right and also be a bully who would never be physically aggressive and would always fake being a non-physically-violent pacifist yet could easily provoke someone else into being violent without saying anything 'I'm just sitting here.....' and be smug with a little hint of a smile and at times shake his head left-and-right in small motions].  Oh and he knew all of this scientific and alternate reality and psychic and time travel stuff in grade school days without learning it at school [they don't teach anything like that to humans in grade school for humans of course and most humans with PHDs can't compete with the knowledge he had or at least I'd imagine so].  It wasn't like he learned it from Carl Sagan or anything on VHS or any stuff on television either as they don't have stuff that extreme on public television or at public libraries on VHS for humans grade school level or otherwise.  [At least not on this planet yikes].  I had also wondered how he knew about ancient Asia and traditional Japanese and Asian cultures and how their honor worked and the psychology worked of all ends of their cultures and lifestyles as if he was a PHD or someone who had actually BEEN there and seen it first-hand.  Oh, and how exactly did he know so much about what actually happened to the Temple of Zion and how exactly the riot that brought it down started as well as some arguement between popes or religious men?  And all this stuff about the guy who actually wrote the orginal Christian Bible and how 'hedonistic' [one of his words he came up with in conversation] he was and a lot more about his personal life than the fact that he never married anyone and also wrote the Bible and did so to establish power over people as a powerful strategic move of some sort?  How did he learn this stuff outside of speculation and what they usually teach in schools?  To be fair he did eventually go to college and almost complete a degree in philosophy although all the stuff about Asia he knew back when he was Dungeon Master with just myself as his only player and 'Dungeons and Dragons Oriental Adventures' long before I ever met Adam Hill or James Gedra.  I don't think they taught that stuff back in junior high school and go that deep and I'm not sure if he had that knowledge in grade school or not as well as the book itself.  Some of the time-space and time travel stuff he and Martin Eric Reeves knew easily and were trying to explain to ME in the kitchen in the old house on Monahan Drive in Virginia when I was in human grade school as I recall and one of them even punched a hole in folded paper to try to describe time travel combined with other techniques to jump like through a wormhole from one side of a universe to another without having to drive a spaceship for a LONG drive in three dimensions as I would [if I could drive.  I had plenty of difficulty navigating in my Toyota once I finally got one and couldn't figure out how to refuel it or change the wiper fluid half the time and the mechanic at one place seemed to think I was joking or playing dumb or otherwise pulling his leg with very serious questions when I really didn't know and actually had to ask.  With humans, I've had this problem for years.  I ask serious questions and really don't understand, not bemused, and they think I'm joking or playing dumb or playing games with them.  Life story, go figure.....].  Sally Lynn Reeves also seemed to already be quite familiar with the time travel and wormhole and time-space methods of rapidly travelling accross the same space and universe but 'skipping over' a huge section of three dimensional space as well and she was quite casual about it as if it were obvious and everyday common knowledge for a woman like her and a mother that she presented herself as.  She also has a way over the years of casually talking about humans from a point of view of not being one of them.  Sometimes she does this flatly over the years and other times with emotion.  There are times she talks with various attitudes and emotions about humans and their cultures from an outside point of view over the years and at times is condescending to their species and at other times educates me and tries to teach me how to deal with them and talk to them while clearly not being a human and not treating me like a human either.  She would do this with how to approach them to socialize and make friends with them in school and stuff and how to make certain first impressions and how humans assume things and get ideas in their heads and jump to conclusions and other stuff as well as recommendations and suggestions for dealing with them and talking to them while not being one of them.  [Human mothers don't ever do anything like that with their human children.  That's my opinion biased as it is from a very little immature young zarakite who actually doesn't know that much sorry.]  There have been times she complains about the body and form she has and is stuck with and ideas humans would get about her when seeing it and what humans would think in their heads if they were to see her in certain ways if she would go to certain areas of a town or something and how she would expect humans to treat her and the body/vessel she has.

Idea #0587:
	Regarding my list of wants that involve humans and sky boys and planet Earth I was told by one exosolar-being (extraterrestrial as in a living being from another world and probably another solar system) long before crazy stuff in my old apartment and before the guides that coined the term 'immortal baby huey' and before there might have been any 'spiritual James Hetfield' or 'doctor Kirk Hammet' who quickly ended up having a scientist lab coat and stuff and before there was any talk of CIA involved or any guy who would walk around with some animated little-kid scribble cartoon hat and stuff [which drove me nuts and hurt my head and was very provacative and was making me furious and ready to scream] that would bully me there was a civilized discussion from an exosolar 'Haldeman guy' that understood me just fine when I was in my apartment and didn't seem to be hard-of-hearing in a psychic way who told me before any discrediting stuff and before any talk of alarms I had never heard of I think that human beings as a species were not going to exist much longer as exactly the same species and would live on biologically as an actual new species kind of like modern humans [homo sapiens sapiens] are not exactly the same as cro-magnon man although he didn't say that they would necessarily do so because of normal natural evolution [actually he didn't bring up natural selection and I didn't either so he didn't say but I didn't ask so there] and he told me that so-called 'humans' would exist and live on planet Earth as a species of 'humans' that would be similar to and would physically be similar to but not the same as homo sapiens sapiens and not necessarily have the same name as a species [I didn't ask him about specifics though he said they 'wouldn't be the same'].  I didn't ask him about how he knew this but he seemed to really know what he was talking about and he also seemed to be very caring and deeply concerned probably because I was fond of some humans and thought I was one of them and didn't understand their nature but thought I did and I didn't understand what race I was but thought I did and I didn't understand who I should fight for or stand up for but thought I did and a bunch of other stuff that was a huge mess and I also didn't understand I wasn't mentally ill either but at times thought I did and at other times remembered how I didn't get put into psychiatry anything like how any human being would and then I had a real eye opener when I opened some old emails from Sally Reeves's computer when her computer wasn't working very well and she wanted me to reformat her computer and reload windows for her or find out if it had spyware or something she didn't understand on it [on planet Earth she always had to pretend and play the part of a human female woman who didn't know computers or technology that well and needed to ask dumb questions about how to send a reply to an email and didn't know how to install software like photoshop or Firefox by herself and she had to pretend to be intellectually close as far as technology to humans who thought that an optical disc drive tray for a CD or DVD was a retractable coffee cup holder or something but at least she could USUALLY turn the blasted infernal contraption on and get it to behave itself and when it didn't she didn't know how to shut it down properly so she would just hold down the power button so that the computer would be forced to turn off without shutting down properly all the way but she apparently wouldn't understand that or how sometimes it would take a bit for the machine to do stuff with the hard drive and this is normal for computers running microsoft windows and the machine is actually behaving itself and seriously being a nice and well behaved blasted little infernal contraption and is supposed to do that.  Laugh it up human a--holes and knock yourselves out har har.]
	SO anyways humans are easily 'reprogrammable' to become robot-like beings according to a human who went by CIA Gary who used that word quite casually to describe his own species with hand motions and gestures who flatly said it straight and while being some gruff miltary-like person [and he probably was].  [That was how he described it and that was the word he chose to use.]  This came up in a conversation about stuff I never heard of and the terms 'mind control' and 'thought control' were mentioned repeatedly and I had never heard of the terms before and had no idea what he was talking about and he [this 'CIA Gary' or whatever] was also depicted in a video transmission or cartoon graphic or something [I think it was an animated cartoon graphic] grabbing what were squares or rectangles that were depictions of some sort of security clearances or credentials of mine and ripping them apart to shreds one after another repeatedly while I was in my kitchen of my apartment.  I had no idea what all of that was about and that was before weird stuff in the parking lot during daytime with lots of sunlight and before any idea of any telepathic imaginary hole being blasted in the ceiling of my apartment's kitchen and stuff going way up into outer space and multiple telepathic renderings simultaneously being rendered but not duplicates of each other and having differences between each other and I had no idea what all that meant or what any of it was about and can't say that I really do now.  Look I know this stuff embarasses the s--- out of human agencies but it's not my fault I never heard of any of this stuff and still don't and I'm just explaining what happened and telling it straight and being literally honest and I'm innocent and others who read this I'm guessing should know what this stuff means and what was going on or at least have a pretty good idea of what all of this stuff means.
	SO anyways to bring things closer to the point we have problems with the fact that humans as a race [I sometimes say 'species'] are very vulnerable to mind control and thought control and are very easy targets for such things not to mention mind-reading.  If humans are to survive this stuff then they need to be turned into a new species with actual brand new body parts that are literally not the same and actually not be the same species.  Cybernetics are a lost cause and an empty promise in many ways and have been long thought up by and encouraged by Martin Eric Reeves and Paul Samuel Reeves as they were over the decades along with squads of Marines with heads attached but without any necks and cyborgs and also psychics and psychic placebo style solutions where people were deluded and for one reason or another would THINK that they were immune to all sorts of evil and psychic stuff but of course wouldn't really know and wouldn't have any actual physical evidence of such anyways but just ideas and feelings and delusions in their heads that lack sanity and such.  Paul Samuel Reeves is really big on that stuff as well as hypnosis and altered states of conciousness and dream-like states and sleepwalking and getting drunk and getting stoned and passing out and people thinking they are whatever and 'seeing sounds' and 'hearing colors' and living their daily lives like such and never being sane or fully awake or sober ever again.  Paul S Reeves by the way is good at describing those sorts of things and how humans can drug themselves and get themselves into such states.  He has a sort of creativity and fascination and liking for doing such things to humans and would come up with ideas and such easily and off the top of his head long before Dungeons and Dragons pen and paper gameplay but with LEGOs way back when very little and in days of grade school and kindergarten and such and GI JOE action figures etc as well as f---ing with space and time and warping and messing with it and weird ideas about designing a space craft that is deceptively built to look like one end is clearly the front and cockpit and the other end is clearly the rear end with a rocket booster for thrust and stuff but surprise surprise the ship went from one solar system to the next with all primary propulsion coming from some innocent and apparently useless side port and the whole ship would fly 'sideways' and he would love to come up with ideas and dumb stuff like that just to play with the minds of anyone else on their spacecraft watching his spacecraft and other dumb stuff like that.  That's 'sooooo him' to come up with ideas like that some girl would say like someone he might make fun of but at the same time date as a 'girlfriend' and maybe be some 'burned-out hippie' girl or 'stoner' or something.
	Gosh isn't it frustrating when you suddenly discover your species is near an abrupt end and then all sorts of other beings and such get involved that you and no one else of your kind have ever heard of suddenly show up or get involved and know far more about your whole species than you and all your freinds of the same species do humans?  I'm actually with humans on this one or at least I thought I was and I've been trying to save your sorry a--es and do something about it and not offer some empty promise with psychic or telepathic or dream-like delusions that run life-long and turn everything into military technology with killswitches and weird 'insurance policies' where untrustworthy evil and self-possessed and self-programmed half-cyborg human military officials from weird agencies want all of you to have bar codes on your brains or what is left of them and control you with all sorts of sneaky underhanded stuff they never tell any of you about.  Paul Samuel Reeves and Martin Eric Reeves actually wanted to offer you humans the same things in one form or another and Sally Lynn Reeves wouldn't have offered you any better.  I'm reffering to what appeared to be the people as they were and not as they are now.  [What are as they appear now are not the same individuals.]

Idea #0588:
	Sally Lynn Reeves of her own initiative brought up in intake appointments and other conversations with clinical psychologists as well as psychiatrists as well as social workers over the decades that I never had any psychotic break in my entire lifetime ever.  I witnessed her do these things quite often and not as quick comments but with elaboration and back and forth discussion.  She did this with numerous such medical professionals and other doctors including cardiologists etc as well including before getting any high school diploma with public high school with humans as well as long afterwards and even with Liz Couz as well and Sally would make sure that this information was well documented and notated and went on record and such would include being sent to all medical insurance organizations as well and would also be on medical charts over the years and in files with multiple hospital networks including Cleveland Clinic hospitals and their computers as well as MetroHealth hospital networks and also Ohio Medicaid but also USA Medicare and Champus TRICARE FOR LIFE which are both federal and not limited to the state of Ohio.  Sally would do these things before and after I turned both eighteen and twenty one and such left extensive paper trails and records over the years including before any Internet was public and frequently available to the common layperson and when only a minority of the common citizens in the USA had dial-up modems that would connect to some BBS their friend would run set up to answer their ordinary telephone and even so that was only the geeks and there were problems sometimes getting someone's answering machine and not weird computer noises then later talking to someone and telling them they couldn't leave a message on their answering machine because they didn't have something set up properly.  Most people didn't do that with their personal home computers back then and only extreme computer geeks did.  Floppy disks back then really were 'floppy' and were the five-and-a-quarter ones much like the ones the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 computers would use although they wouldn't format the discs the same way.  Kinda funny how back in those days the kids from grade school who happened to have computers like those and had computer games always had one or two games that never worked anymore because they JUST HAD TO do what they heard they shouldn't with a floppy disc and a magnet from a refrigerator and do some dumb s--- with the two objects.  Look I hate to be condescending to humans again but Paul S Reeves made a comment one time about how human children are just suckers for always experimenting with things like that especially the computer dorks I guess and he seemed to be right.  Go figure.  Well hey at least some of their music is pretty good.  They came up with Metallica and twinkies and some other cool stuff.  I never got used to 'reality TV' and hate that stuff and always will the way they do it but they've got some good stuff they've come up with.  That and their young and teenage boys can be hot and fun to masterbate over if they stay thin and skinny and don't mess themselves up with drugs or drinking or smoking or unhealthy stuff that makes me cringe when they do certain things like that to themselves.  Many don't fortunately.  I feel really bad that some of them have these weird cravings and desires where they feel they 'just have to' DAMAGE themselves and 'they can't help it' and if they are desperate for street drugs and are in a quiet suburban town where most or all are Caucasian white and they can't really get street drugs if they wanted and their parents are also clean-cut they start snorting and inhaling cleaning products and detergents from under the sink and freon and chemicals from refrigerators and air conditioners and stuff in desperation to get cheap highs.  Yikes.  I really hate to see them do these things to themselves and ruin themselves and always have.  Just seeing some humans do that stuff makes me cringe and feel for them as a species.  It's no wonder the spirit of the human species is I guess screaming 'save us from this s---' in one form or another and I've kinda picked up on that more than once over the past several years [long story].

Idea #0589:
	Zarakites that conduct military operations involve using weapons and using them for lethal force and with the honest intent of killing hostiles with lethal physical violence which leaves dead bodies and physical material evidence behind.  Such is mandatory for ALL zarakite military operations ANYWHERE and EVERYWHERE with ABSOLUTELY AND LITERALLY NO EXCEPTIONS.

Idea #0590:
	According to zarakite values most psychics are evil.

Idea #0591:
	According to zarakite values any telepathy that can go anywhere including to unknown recipients is evil.

Idea #0592:
	Illusions as well as holograms and even more so hallucinations are all very much the style of the Dark Hearted Prince Paul Samuel Reeves and well ingrained and well favored by aforementioned Paulists as such.  These things are a major part of Paulist evils which are too dangerous and too evil for planet Earth as well as this universe.  Such aforementioned evils are unforgivealbly and extremely evil in zarakite values to the point that lack of punishment for such is prohibited and cannot be tolerated according to zarakite values.

Idea #0593:
	Drop any Mike Warnick as well as Brian Holland also known by his stage name Dexter Holland.  Drop Eric Harris.  Drop any current Eric Droder and Eric Drottar as they are both secret agents to fight the dark hearted and consider the orginal Eric Droder from NO junior high school also known as North Olmsted Middle School.  Drop the current stately Joseph Amato who I thought the whole time was the real one I wanted and replace him with the Joseph Amato from junior high school right after the caterpillar and was also in junior high school gym class and such.  Make sure that the Chuck Hammel that is an Original and Chosen is the one from junior high school North Olmsted who had a spike top haircut that looked black and sat next to me in sixth grade English class and was so called climbing all over me and had his own way of interpreting that and was also in the same gym class and such.  That Chuck also might be the same one as the Chuck with the literal name Charles as a first name and I did not actually know that Chuck is a common nickname for Charles and it was brought up with him at some ceremony for doing really good at math and science intellectual stuff and an award was won for high math scores and Chuck also got some award or something and it said Charles on his certificate or medal or something and he was of course surprised when asked about why it said Charles and not the name Chuck he was known for having that everyone called him and the poor guy was not prepared for answering a question like that about answering to Chuck short for Charles and was like uh what planet are you from yikes which humans do when they meet other people and other folk from their own world that are intelligent but are not human and some other race or species as humans raise their own like that unfortunately and in recent times especially are not used to other types of people like dragons or enchanted or magical races or shapeshifters and such.  Also drop the name Joseph for one of J M S family who has the same face and is from the same lesser family and is a half dragon.

Idea #0594:
	Loose ideas
	Steve Schlaf his bike injury and looking down his shirt and his innocence and how he took it rather well and things were not his fault and conversation going out to his car and he was still willing to sit nearby and his blond hair and how he was asked if it was real and how he wore an undershirt later and how he was starting to take music classes and wanted to try changing majors and wanted my help with his music classes and how he wanted to run a business or something and considered helping people but didn't want to do medical school or at least claimed such in front of the class and his artistic talents and he can draw really good with a pencil and he seemed like a popular kid and his story about riding his bike and getting into trouble with a cop and giving the cop a false name and 'sorry sir but you are pointing to the wrong pillar' while keeping a straight face and the humor from such and passing him some notes and he sat in another seat and we both got away with it for philosophy class at least once and he was a fast and reckless driver and couldn't help it but admitted it and his driving record and he's from Brecksville and very attractive and thinks or thought that North Olmsted is where 'rich people live' and he hated bullies from Garfield Heights who were mean to him at one vocaltional school or school or something and he tried learning to play electric guitar at one point and had an Ibanez when he was a teenager and didn't end up sticking with it and 'Ste' and music that 'has gotta have a beat' and he has migraine headaches [for now] and stayed very thin and sexually attractive and at one point had to run to his car before class to grab a sandwich so he wouldn't pass out and he may have been starving himself to be thin and he would flirt with quite a few college girls left and right even though he already has his own girlfriend who lived at home with him and his girlfriend's dad didn't want her and wouldn't take her back and Steve's parents allowed him to do this and Steve has a loving mother and Steve's dad stopped supporting giving him birthday presents when Steve got past eighteen or nineteen years old or something but his mother would get him something without telling his dad and there was cheering him on while walking out to his car after class one day when he had his birthday in Novemeber [Scorpio] about how 'he's no longer a teenager' as 'twenty' is not 'nineteen' and 'nineteen' has 'teen' in it although that part wasn't even mentioned out loud and he just understood anyways without either of us having to be extraneous or dorky and yes humans work with that type of conversation where things don't need to be over-explained yikes and Steve was a good buddy and was charming and funny at times and had good jokes and the way he would talk and also describe what people were like for example the professor who was expecting me in the class and he held up his hand and imitated a ticked off feline at one point and a phone recording for the voice mail of one of his buddies and stuff and he was friendly and nice about how I had a lot of Metallica songs in my MP3 player and stuff and he was easy for me to talk to about some stuff and he explained and pointed out human behaviour and how humans work a little bit and what humans mean when they do things even if he had to whisper and keep it quiet for example the one time in the mens room so I wouldn't be a complete idiot about humans and he did this type of thing giving me this guidance without even realizing it of course geez and Jenson's 'I didn't ask for this' combined with 'Officer so and so volunteers...' from the Keanu Reeves movie 'Speed' slammed together kinda applied and actually still does and I still feel for him and he wasn't ever gay or homosexual so pipe down spirits geez some of you can be assholes sometimes yikes at least we're getting some serious work done and yes Steve when he was nineteen and twenty years old was HOT to the zarakite sex drive and definetely a keeper and his voice and style and personality as well and he's not gay and the zarakite sex drive isn't homosexual or even human so don't jump to conclusions all over again a-holes and he actually would have naturally been in a LOT more MD if it weren't for unusual external-based factors that interfered including but not limited to unusual plastic/artificial difficulty remembering Steve's face and what it looked like and also trying in futility to find it in the two videos from class with much frustration both more recently as well as before type five and weird plastic stuff that was also dark trio and dark hearted that didn't want self to keep in touch with Steve and call him more often including after Philosophy and Speech classes and how self wanted to work again a part time job and Steve actually tried to hook me up with driving the truck with the fire restoration business his family worked in and this is probably not very relevant but he told me during those days when we were classmates in those two classes that he had an older brother who also worked in the same business of fire restoration who also had blond hair and had a mustache and also he told me during those days in the hallway in chairs between classes about his nationality and how it was completely German on both his mother's and father's sides and their last names were 'Grosse' and 'Schlaf' which in English means 'great' and 'sleep' according to what he told me although I have to admit that for one with a zarakite sex drive he is worth and very stimulating of daydreaming about especially how he was back then and no he did not ever pose or posture or stick out his belly or put his fingers in his mouth or act like a homo contrary to some spirits who 'haven't gotten the memo' or need to 'get with the program' as the saying goes.  I remember his charming voice and the way he would talk and pronounce things and it really was very nice and attactive and appealing to me and my taste in asthetics and likes as well as the zarakite sex drive not to mention fairly unique and uncommon [ie 'wait a sec, I know that voice...'] and distinctive and pleasant to hear and most humans who are boys don't and can't talk that way or sound that way especially naturally so when they are nineteen and twenty years old.  Also he has really good social intelligence that works for a popular boy in school that is healthy and lacks any disorders and is also characteristic of someone that many would want to be friends with and hang out with.  [That's what 'popular' in this context refers to of course duh.]  The way he was when he was nineteen and an adolescent and teenager as a human has a lot of competition from both the zarakite sex drive [which is uniformally male] and the human female sex drive.  As for the male human sex drive that is heterosexual I don't know and never asked anyone although he seemed like a guy that easily had male human friends in high school and stuff.  As for homosexual and transgender and other sex drives I don't know much about those and humans of both genders who are like that are weird fuckers anyways and I never connected or wanted to hang out with those types anyways.  As for NORMAL human sex drives though he would easily flirt with human females left and right and it seemed that human males of various sorts and even a few African Americans seemed to want to be friends with him from what I noticed although it's not like I'm a psychologist or expert in personalities of another race or species or anything.  The Dark Queen is into that stuff and always was although there are others who are not from Earth who do stuff like that too who vary and arn't the same.  I also remember the joke we had about Steve camping out in the woods with his girlfriend and how I asked him 'did you actually kill someting and eat it [after cooking it over a campfire]' and he laughed with 'almost' and I'm still guessing to this day he and I probably had very different ideas of what we both meant.  That and he had plenty of sex with his girlfriend back then and enjoyed it like any normal and healthy human guy his age did and should at nineteen give or take.  [That's normal of course although humans don't talk about it quite the same way which is very HUMAN as in 'normal' for his kind and I'm quite sure they get very different ideas in their heads when they daydream and imagine stuff and get horny and masterbate and want to have sex than zarakites and sky boys do.  I'm not an expert or even a grown up and as such a poor judge of his kind but for humans I think that's normal.]  I remember he also has a generous side and likes to share stuff with his friends and buddies he hangs out with.  I also remember when the last days of the semester came and we walked around campus after the exams were done and stuff and they had games and activities on campus and other stuff students could do for fun and I was holding in my fecal matter and had my own issues at one point being young and if it wasn't for that or the weird timing of when it happened that were kinda funny [as if] then Steve and I would have tried out one of the things he wanted to try that wasn't swordfighting but was something with sticks and mock/pretend fighting back and forth with padded staves on a mat that we both would have enjoyed I'd think although to be fair I remember Karate class when there was sparring and I and a sparring partner both had all the pads and helmets and protective gear and without knowning what was going on I did something non-human when it came to punching attacks while following instructions for sparring that later left the poor girl I was sparring with ending up with a swollen face and cheeks and redness and injury as the pads and helmets were designed for humans and not any type of punch or physical attack I was capable of and I remember she was weird and platic when I later found out and felt sorry for her and apologized and she was like a space case kind of like the professor for the Speech class Steve and I were both in where she could have had her hair and head on fire and I could have said 'By the way your head is on fire and you might want to stick it in a nearby toilet' and she would nod her head and my words would have gone in one of her ears and out the other and I might as well have been 'what is this Candid Camera'? and she would not remember any of the conversation of course just like similar weird stuff that I didn't know was going on my whole life that bounced between the ears of other humans all the time and I never knew including Steve himself and various schoolteachers and classmates in other schools etc and I'm not in the mood for telling the long version all over again and those reading this might forget about it later anyways as most humans end up doing that.....

Idea #0595:
	Aircraft elevators rudder artificial horizon flaps throttle afterburners cross between sex and a car crash Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Simulator Commodore 64 version which was public and marketed to the masses in the 1980s and I actually read the manual to learn such stuff like maybe 'RTM before it becomes RTFM' is actually a good idea and part of a good value system that actually works in real life tried and true go figure [It did have a rather thick manual and it was educational software anyways and did have plenty of content not in the game or gameplay about both civilian and military aircraft and experiences actual seasoned and veteran pilots had and not just his own back then and by the way his face and likeness reminded me of Grandpa Tom quite a bit for some odd reason though maybe its because some humans who are men who go bald and get heavyset get like that when they grow old and Grandpa tom himself said that he felt rather 'generic' when he got up in his years and actually made conversation of that type of thing and how he said he felt like he could 'go into a room full of "old people" who looked like himself and blend in and get lost among them and no one would tell the difference between him and a bunch of other humans like him that were very common at that age' and it's kinda interesting how he picked up on that and made conversation out of it out of the blue and taking me by surprise when I was in the room one day and also was careful not to start the conversation with me directly but did it so I could eavesdrop on it and not miss it and he was pretty good at doing that with conversations and it actually fooled the dark hearted queen who didn't understand it and he was rather slick about it go figure oh and he managed to do the same sort of thing with another one of his tricks about Paul S Reeves's personality and how unusual it was and how rigid-minded and weird Paul's non-human personality was and what it was like to fix a garage door or work with him building something or work on any project with him when I wasn't around and stuff.....]  [He sure knew what he was doing.  Now that I think about it I'm not sure how many of him I had over the years.]  [He was the one I'd say who taught me how the military discovered that human militaries don't bomb the s--- out of an area to root out a single bad guy and that technique has been well studied and researched and has been proven to be lousy and unfavored as a bad strategy and technique that really doesn't work very well and such was done while watching the movie 'Remo Williams The Adventure Begins' near the end where the protagonist was in a forest area by himself and his opponents were bombing and blowing up trees and dirt and grass and the whole side of the mountain left and right around him with tons of explosives just to kill him specifically and Grandpa Tom said was explaining how that's a bad approach to dealing with an enemy combatant and how real human soldier class that is professional wouldn't do something screwball like that and would use other methods instead.  That was one of a number of stories he had about humans and how they face warfare in various situations including others such as how sometimes it is better to be a foot soldier with a machine gun rifle and be running inbetween trees and around hills and roads and bridges and buildings then be in a battletank which is a big target and also how battletanks tear up civilian roads and parking lots and weigh far more than civilian cars and trucks and also the 'why don't you just' idea I brought up with him one time as a 'what if' about putting either a very large turrent or many little turrents on one really large battletank and putting so many eggs in one basket and how the Germans at one point tried that with their own top secret R and D and built a prototype that was too big to drive down a road properly then fell over and they couldn't get it back upright again and overall they decided to can the project but at least they tried it and also he participated in a demonstration of the Tow-2 missle launcher back when it was a prototype and he was an expert who was in the audience and he described what it was like going out to the place to see someone else's prototype being demonstrated and how one missle didn't work right and then another was a likewise disaster and the announcer then said 'this concludes our demonstration of the missle system' and everyone had to be professional and keep a straight face about someone's pride and joy not working very well and being rather embarassing and I guess such is how government and miltary works and yes a human could hypothetically get a speeding ticket in battletanks they had in the 1980s on a public ordinary USA highway where the speed limit was 55 MPH and such and yes many battletanks that the US military had on roads like that could be cranked up to upwards of 80 to 90 MPH and that type of thing wasn't unusual for American military battletanks not that I've ever test driven one and I had to shop for used civilian stuff anyways at the dealership where I got my Toyota because mommy and daddy in other words the dark king and dark queen who paid for it and full and wouldn't tolerate making recurring montly payments or anything and insisted on just buying it for me and leaving it all in my name free and clear wouldn't tolerate otherwise at Sunnyside Toyota in North Olmsted Ohio where I got my Corolla from a salesperson named Ron Swetland as I recall and we also checked out a KIA which was pathetic and puny and like an insect on the road no offense in the lanes between vechicles left and right and we went with getting the Corolla which had three previous owners and no accidents ever and was Canadian built where they have tough quality standards that were superior to what the manufacturing plants in USA did.  Oh and Grandpa Tom also had answers to questions and conversations about bullet-proof versions of civilian cars and how to get one and how they are built and how they handle differently in the USA but look exactly identical to the normal versions of such makes and models.  Coincidentally I recall conversations with uniformed police officer co-workers at Tri-C who in the back office during break times and slow times and near the coffee pot would talk about some of the same stuff and also how USA human police cars are actually not normally armored or bullet-proof and are actually moving targets and can be shot through just as easily as civilian cars and trucks and stuff typically.  That and a few dumb crackpot little-kiddy jokes about how seeing their patrol cars in the parking lot at Tri-C with the lightbar poking above the parked cars driving between the rows of parked cars might as well have been like seeing a big shark's fin poking up above the cars moving back and forth and stuff if one is standing in the parking lot on their feet as in not airborne.  Oh and the dark hearted prince Paul Samuel Reeves when he was a human-ish teenager or whatever the hell he was back in the 1990s and perhaps 1980s started a conversation about how he wanted a human police car when he would get a car and start driving and stuff because according to his words 'police cars arn't "downtuned" like civilian cars are' and over the years similar conversation came up with Grandpa Tom and how back when civilian cars had six volt car batteries military vehicles from the USA had twelve volt and then when civilian cars later had twelve volt then military vehicles had twenty four volt and Grandpa Tom described how even civilian cars and trucks in the USA can drive through flooded areas okay if the 'ignitiion' and 'air intake' is high up enough with how the vehicle is built and he had his own first-hand experiences and stories about driving one of his pickup trucks through a flooded area where there was water from outside above the gas and brake pedals and his truck still drove through it just fine.  These talks came long before a movie came out with Peirce Brosnan playing a vulcanologist who had a truck with what Granpa Tom was talking about deliberately installed on it in the movie.  Also I remember standing outside Victoria Plaza Apartments and talking with Matthew Damron face to face of course about cars and I mentioned police cars not being downtuned like civilian cars because of what I learned from talks with Grandpa Tom and Paul S Reeves and he made his own comments about USA police cars and seemed to know a lot of knowledge of his own of technical stuff about how cars work that were way over my head and beyond what I know about and he kept a straight face yet also talked a bit weird and different and not with the normal usual personality he normally would have.  The way he was briefly intellecutal about it and talking like a totally different person was rather odd.  I don't know if he might have been someone other than what he claimed to be from talking like that or if it was anything like what happened with classmates at school and Steve Schlaf and the Speech professor we both had and police officers I had as co-workers at times or perhaps some combination of the two things.  He referring to Matthew Damron sure did get into talks quite easily about the Ancient Egyptians and how they built the pyramids without modern technology that still couldn't come close and other talks about ancient civilizations and 'space aliens' and turned into a different person with such talks over a number of years when he would be inside my apartment visiting as a friend or something and he sure did seem very intellectual and well-educated for a human guy who never graduated from high school and never got a GED either and hung out with junkies and other drug users and drug users and was proud of that type of thing when he was in high school and in later years and when he would talk in conversations in my apartment he would boast about and be proud of that type of thing as well as what its like to be arrested and also have the skill to walk away from all friends and family and drive away and not come back and not ever call anyone and just spur-of-the-moment walk away from one's entire life on a random whim and how he loved having that skill and claimed he could do that and was proud of it.  He sounded like some movie I once say with Al Pacino and Rober Deniro with bank robbers and Val Kilmer where the fiction bank robbers robbed a bank and some of the bank robbers did just that in the film to escape being arrested and make a run for it.  Matthew Damron also taught his innocent nephew Tommy his own bad habits and I witnessed this face to face firsthand when Matthew took him and myself to where his newphew lived so I could work on Tommy's computer and his mother wasn't home and Matthew boxed his nephew's ears scolding him for answering the door when he/Matthew knocked like any normal human would who lived in some quiet suburbs and was expecting family to come visit and there was an expected knock at the front door and I would expect civilized decent behavior would be involved like answering the door of course and doing so for any company of course.  Also, it wasn't like Matt parked his car on the roof or I tried to come in through the window with him.  Granted Tommy lived with his mother Angela in an apartment on the ground floor in their apartment building, but, still.....]

Idea #0596:
	Paul Samuel Reeves always had a personality where he thought that everyone should do things his way and his way only, and that 'his way' was 'THE way' [as in no one else has a right to have their own way or even their own opinion].  He would sometimes use his own name to refer to 'his way' when talking out loud and whining and complaining in a whiny voice making conversation about how he hated the way humans would act and behave at times and he would say that people were not doing the right thing according to his opinions and his values by 'not doing it the Paul S Reeves way'.  He would criticize and scold humans behind their back with the way they would drive their cars, fix their cars, program computer software including video games, run their governments, teach and educate the masses regarding the laws of physics, establish their [human, again] 'laws of gravity' in scientific physics taught in high schools and higher education and Paul would also complain and whine like a complaining upset little boy about how the human theories of how gravity works is 'flawed' according to his criticism and such.  These conversations didn't come up too often but he seemed to be some unhappy person who didn't manage his emotions very well and would keep things bottled up and then once in a while at random he would involuntarily have whining outbursts he didn't manage or control very well where he would talk and talk and talk like a little upset boy about how human didn't understand logic or science or their own laws and theories of physics and gravity and astronomy and string theory very well and perpetuated their ideas in schools and universities and they were all messed up as well as offensive to him according to his opinions.  He would do this with uncontrolled mundane verbal outbursts and tirades at times, mouthing off out loud and a bit vocal just like a human being would use their lips and vocal cords to do the exact same sort of thing.  His non-human intelligence and sceintific and cultural knowledge would be given away when he would do this, with his guard let down, and his usual tactics for secrecy and delusion and induced amnesia and other ways of covering up his blunders not working on myself of course.  It's no wonder he preferred to distance himself from me over the years including during as well as outside of school and he favored moving away and also not answering phone messages or emails for more than a year or two at a time for holidays and birthdays and made himself very difficult to get a hold of over recent decades and wouldn't typically be up for conversation about ANYTHING.  He also avoids doctor's offices and hospitals and nursing homes and other such 'medical' places like the plague and over the years would never willingly visit anyone in such places and with lifelong history and pretense wouldn't be caught dead visiting myself in a nursing home even though I'm not in a locked unit.  He's always been like that.  Also once he move out after high school he refused, for DECADES, to have any doctor for any ordinary boring common checkup and also refused to have any dentist as well.  Talk about avoiding everything medical and everyone caught up in it.  Also he reluctantly drove himself to a small-town rural emergency room after having a heart attack at the age of 22 (twenty-two) and not calling any paramedics or 911 about it.  He was also into jogging and exercising at the time and not being overweight and also getting into running and sprinting and developing ab muscles that would visibly show at one point and he actually got punished for developing such a body and physique and atheletic lifestyle as he really wasn't supposed to do that sort of thing on planet Earth and was breaking rules.  He always did however favor very broad shoulders and a pronounced curvature of the spine that humans have and would never have any straight-as-an-arrow spine that zarakites and sky boys would have.  He would never put up with being very skinny including having narrow shoulders and muscles that arn't too big, and instead he has always favored bulky muscles and a lot of brawn and being like Arnold Schwarzenegger and idolizing such a physique and at the same time he was usually okay with having at least some belly fat over the decades or more accurately I suspect he was supposed to pretend to if he were following rules for himself on planet Earth.  He also has always had somewhat wavy hair that if grown long would never naturally hang straight.  He sometimes grew long hair during teenage years which he would love to either have in a ponytail or have braided.  He also didn't ever mind the idea of having any receding hairline or 'distinguished' look to his hairline.  Either that or he was pretending to and was following rules.  He never seemed to mind having a sportcoat or wearing a necktie and always seemed naturally comfy and at ease doing such things and seemed to favor and enjoy such over the decades.  He was also always a whiny unhappy teenager who never developed a human teenager personality and never seemed to want to and always seemed to want childhood and teenage years to be over and done with as soon as possible.  He never seemed to be interested in fun or recreation as any teenagers have in American culture if aforementioned teenagers are law-abiding and not stoners or drug-using alchohol-drinking types, and he seemed like healthy fun as an American teenager would have it was 'beneath him' and 'inferior' and always seemed far more interested in 'grown up' lifestyles with neckties and wedding tuxedos and sportcoats and getting married and being done with school and starting careers and maintaining long careers and being too old for video games and skateboarding and such.  He was also into woodstock and the side of it that was always stoned and high and passing out and 'meditating' [comatose from brain damage which he turns into the same thing] from LSD and 'smoking weed' and drinking alchohol and such.  He was also big into going to bars over the years.  He would also make fun of humans doing these sorts of things and would be 'do as I say but not as I do' and 'rules apply to everyone other than me but not myself' in his own ways and not really the same ways as Sally Lynn Reeves would do in her own ways over the decades.  Despite going out to bars and dancing and concerts so often he would somehow always be an outcast of sorts and would not really make or keep friends or socialize as any human would, and he also had more than one obvious mid-life crisis over the decades where he wouldn't leave his house in Nevada and wouldn't answer the phone or any emails and wouldn't talk to his next-door neighbors and wouldn't talk to Sally Lynn Reeves either.  He also wouldn't go to 'work' as his so-called 'career' in the entertainment industry.  On the other hand it wasn't like his finances were ever in any danger or his investment or other banks accounts of various sorts as well as retirement nest egg[s] at any time as he didn't have to actually work any job and could do what he wanted whenever he wanted to and his 'mommy' and 'daddy' always had plenty of inheritance money from so many relatives who died and left last wills that for whatever mysterious reasons 'accidentally' disappeared or were not found and ended up in his hands in many cases along with property and other stuff which of course the 'younger brother' was never to find out about or discover if they had their ways.  This aforementioned 'younger brother' didn't know back when he had his apartment in North Olmsted Victoria Plaza including up until the last time he ever saw that place thanks to not only being lied to and misled by the rest of the Reeves 'family' for his whole life but also because of Matthew Damron and Larry Falasca and other bad humans with their own deceptions and mind games and tricks and such that they pulled on this aforementioned 'younger brother' and got away with while he lived in North Olmsted while having so much fun indulging in getting away with it with a thing called 'impunity'.  Along with Matthew Damron were a lot of his own close buddies who were in on it in the entire apartment building including the leasing office staff and management and next-door neighbors of this aforementioned 'younger brother' who sure had fun messing with him and also the North Olmsted Police Department in so many ways and their heads and not just when this 'younger brother' would call them over the years.  Matthew Damron at one time made conversation of the North Olmsted Police where he was bragging and proud of how the local police were 'blind' and wouldn't ever notice or catch anything or anyone, as Matthew and his lackeys didn't have anything to do with any of it, which included Ron Marchie at times and many downtown urban types who came in and out of the building and didn't always live there but were very involved in drug using and drug dealing and were probably behind the gunshots fired outside the building that I personally saw first-hand including the muzzle flashes from more than one shot and the screaching tires of the car racing away down Country Club Blvd towards the highway that night just one night out of many I witnessed such things not that the local police would take me seriously about such things or understand or remember any reports of such anyways [isn't weird amnesia and deja vu on a frequent basis 'fun'?  Gosh they had it just being in any of the parking lots I remember witnessing many times over the years including if they never went into the building.  On a hunch, something tells me it was 'fun for the whole [extended] family' so to speak and quite a few take note of that and know what to do with it.  Shit I hate being blackmailed.  Look, humans are humans, but they do have some good things, and they are from the same damn planet I am, and I do respect at least some of their police and soldier class and what they stand for even when they arn't always allowed or able to do it the best ways.  Playing with their minds with mind games and for personal sick diabolical entertainment and getting pleasure from such evil is characteristic not only of Matthew Damron and people like him who are evil as fuck and really deserve to be put in their place for all time but also Paul Samuel Reeves as he has always been over the decades and also Martin Eric Reeves and the orginal Sally Lynn Reeves at times that come and go over the decades.]

Idea #0597:
	When a zarakite is spending time with a black [Negro] friend [boyfriend or girlfriend, non-sky-boy and non-human as well as non-Earth-origin beings don't apply to this Idea], he might find it beneficial to not take off his whites, as black friends will then find it much easier to see him as a zarakite and not as a 'white guy' ancient.  Granted, his friends that are black might very well still be polite anyways, but its still easier.  This is because of subconcious involuntary stuff with the way people's brains work, as well as practical stuff, such as honest mistakes and also having to explain things sometimes.  I guess this makes sense.

Idea #0598:
	Becoming a rookie police officer that even graduates an academy in the first place, which is required to become a candidate to be hired as a cop with no way around it, requires passing psych tests and having social skills that I know I lack as I'm just a kid.  I guess this makes sense.

Idea #0599:
	I'm not sure if sky boys and hybrids and ancients will have five levels of muscles, or three, or whatever, in whatever combination, for now.

Idea #0600:
	TigerStone faced boys can be bullies.  I guess this makes sense.

Idea #0601:
	Zarakites and half zarakites rape and sexually assault sky boys, humans, and hybrids, including each other, which is both normal as well as expected for both them and the zarakite sex drive which are both used to this.  Zarakite values do not see this as evil, when 'human' in this context is assumed to mean 'ancient' and not 'archaic'.  Note for reference that 'archaic' refers to homo sapiens sapiens as a species in a literal sense as they have lived after the fall of Ancient Egypt, and for the most part onwards, I guess.  Rape, as well as sexual assault, internal to sky boys and hybrids as well as ancients, is a set of collective concepts that altogether is not in itself criminal or even illicit, according to zarakite values as well as Zarakite Law.  This/such is by default.  This I guess makes sense.

Idea #0602:
	TigerStone faced boys don't like to get into trouble, but like to prank and be playful, yet if they think they would not get away with a prank, and-or they don't otherwise feel it would be worth it, they will not pull any such practical joke or mayhem or trick on someone.  I don't know how this makes sense.

Idea #0603:
	Cosmetic changes to a sky boy's hair, assumed to be natural, include potential changes to both sides of a sky boy's scalp hair independently.  I think this makes sense.

Idea #0604:
	Wings of any dragon sky boy cannot ever have natural black feathers including with any cosmetic changes.  I don't think this quite makes sense.

Idea #0605:
	Loose ideas that involve changing ones muscle sizes include - all changes to one's muscle sizes being uniform and the same level head to toe, perhaps the previous also being applicable with detachables that are still tethered, changes to one's own muscle size level [an integer digit which can be represented as such on a sky boy's wristwatch] changing for a short amount of time temporarily in reaction to another boy's erection/boner/hard-on then automatically changing back after no longer being horny/hot/hot-and-horny and-or after a certain amount of time passes, the previous leading to a temporary 'power-up' with hunting and in the wilderness for sky children but also for boys in school sports etc, one or more of the previous being from one's own sexual-arousal/boner/erection/hard-on, deliberate changes that don't change back automatically from fingering one's gut/belly-button/belly [which by the way is ALWAYS an 'innie' and never an 'outie' as the latter is replusive and freakish to the zarakite sex drive while the former is NORMAL as the zarakite sex drive sees it thank you very much], changing a hybrid's muscle level with sex, making a new torso and-or body for a hybrid with a different muscle level [for sports as well as gym class and going out to a skate park or beach and for snowboarding or something] -.  Also somewhat related is making a hybrid body that is taller or shorter than normal for a hybrid doing sports for a high school sports team etc and what this means for dragon sky boys and sky children and other sky boys and such with logical extrapolations of course.  Sky children when no longer being an arctic-white skinned hybrid living an outdoor life with no actual home or bedroom both day and night and in all types of weather but still coming into towns to have fun and socialize and play basketball with heads and eat and have sex and play a few video games for a tiny rare little bit maybe and other fun stuff...  Sky children used to swordfighting each other and waiting for a dragon sky boy to give them their milk and grow them a new skin and give them their gloves but sometimes and maybe often not after social stuff and sex.  Sky children doing something similar to the previous but being attached to a new skin by some sky boy who isn't a sky child.  Various sky boys who are not sky children attaching and detaching various detachables for sky children for various reasons including of course their sexual desires and playfulness.  The previous being applicable with 'dragon boys' [only] instead of 'sky boys who are not sky children' and kahjeet not being able to manage detachables of sky children in at least some cases where the male kahjeet cannot manage detachables for sky children but female ones can and this helps them parent ancients and hybrids and in rare cases sky children in some combination and irregardless this doesn't affect whatever elves and other sky boy races that haven't been mentioned can or can't do with a sky child's detachables.  Penile squirt gun type of fun with boys spraying each other for various reasons and not just bathing and such includes hybrids and ancients as well.  'Race' to sky boys does not mean the same as it does with archaics but both sky boys as well as ancients at least arn't dumb and understand both meanings of 'race' in various types of English during the transition period at least considering cultures that archaics and possibly ancients as a result may/might have.  All these things in some combinations or whatever of what I guess are still loose ideas will eventually one way or another do or don't make sense.

Idea #0606:
	'Bitch' can sometimes refer to a guy and not a girl, and this isn't necessarily just a 'black thing' or something from Black English either as I know from personal first-hand experience.

Idea #0607:
	I know from personal first-hand experience that girls and women can and do give middle fingers just like boys and men do and even rag on someone socially just like males do with both co-workers and even friends.  I've seen this more than once with both a civilian human and also an exosolar presenting herself as a female archaic but I admit with a non-human and non-sky-boy personality that also doesn't I think fit any ancient or hybrid but I don't actually know.  I suspect at least one female uniformed USA human police officer I was a little familiar with could do the same but I never asked.

Idea #0608:
	I don't find it unusual for a female to, when angered and stressed and-or treated unfairly and-or perhaps bullied and irregardless victimized, say 'suck my dick' when she doesn't have one or perhaps does [I've got no problem hanging out with a female who handles such with literal dripping blood and in this hypothetical actually would ignore such a thing as trivial and 'missing the big picture' as well as something that would naturally anger her even more if it became conversation and instead focus on what is upsetting the aforementioned female of course].  I also don't do anything like a dork like what Paul Samuel Reeves would do over the years when a human female would say such a thing in a movie.  I never did.  This makes sense.

Idea #0609:
	Dicks cannot go into buttholes.  NO WAY.  Don't even try it with the zarakite sex drive or what it would even experiment with, no matter how hard bullied.  THIS MAKES SENSE.

Idea #0610:
	If a sky boy says that someone 'has metal in their microwave' then this is comparable to an archaic saying that someone 'isn't playing with a full deck' or 'has a screw loose'.

Idea #0611:
	Remington P is still evil according to zarakite values of every Destructavator and every David A Reeves born with the social security number 287-74-8719 and every Zare of SkyCrown and every Zare of SkyCrowne and every Remington and every Remington's Remington etc of all kinds both logical and illogical and all the other stuff as well so broad that such includes razors and guns as well as urges and cravings of all archaics that have such guns in whatever intensities so that this whole collection of stuff is just according to my collective zarakite values including extrapolations from 'junk' and it MAKES SENSE.

Idea #0612:
	'Platinum blond' to me as I think I've seen it looks too white to my eyes and too much like an old guy.

Idea #0613:
	What I call 'blond' and think of as 'blond' as it applies to scalp hair is what the wikipedia calls 'gold' under the article 'yellow' and I'd imagine a teenage boy who is sexy to the zarakite sex drive with such hair.

Idea #0614:
	When someome with brown hair washes their hair and dries it really well with a blowdryer I don't call it blond, I call it light brown, and they need to look at it right next to actual blond hair and they'll see exactly what I'm talking about like that.

Idea #0615:
	Loose ideas include - magenta, red, violet, blue [high blue], green [rare], yellow, black [limited], blond, orange, pale pastel but highly intense/saturated/vivid light purple - for hair colors.

Idea #0616:
	Physical violence is the primary way to fight enemies, for all purposes, according to zarakite values. 'nuffs said.  This MAKES SENSE.

Idea #0617:
	According to zarakite logic, all-or-nothing possession works. 'nuffs said.  This MAKES SENSE.

Idea #0618:
	According to zarakite logic, all-or-nothing mind control works. 'nuffs said.  This MAKES SENSE.

Idea #0619:
	According to zarakite logic, all-or-nothing thought control works. 'nuffs said.  This MAKES SENSE.

Idea #0620:
	If I am being mistreated according to - my own likes, my dislikes, what I think is fair, what I think is reasonable, what I think isn't fair, my values, any religion I have, my beliefs, my values, zarakite values [compared to my values, hey, same thing of course], SkyCrown, what is good in a universal-sense/within-the-scope-of-the-entire-universe-I-and-my-body-live-and-exist-in, what is evil in a universal-sense/within-the-scope-of-the-entire-universe-I-and-my-body-live-and-exist-in - then I should not be working in at least certain ways.  This is something a muskrat told me and it is really good advice I should have had a long time ago.  They really were correct in that I should have had them as guides to begin with and a long time ago and consistently and they would have been the best exosolars I should have been with initially and life-long first and foremost.  I know at least one of them has dedicated and promised to be a kahjeet and I still want the rest to still have their own world as it is to begin with and un-fucked-with as much as possible not to mention protected.  It really is a damn shame that I was stuck with the wrong guides to begin with when the Type Five Incident started and I had no one I was able or allowed to trust or turn to including old friends and human beings I thought I could trust and turn to.  It's also really bad that Remington Phillips turned out to have been a spy for a Russian spy agency to begin with as well as someone who wasn't authorized or supposed to be part of any failsafe team and wasn't cleared for any failsafe project or any related program to begin with and was with an illegal and illicit spy agency group that was hostile and an enemy of failsafe team staff and exosolars and was part of a group with it's own secret agenda that actually wasn't with Russia or Putin either and was actually with no one as he wanted to take over planet Earth and not be anyone's ally and be an immortal and his own groups actually had secret agendas and lack of loyalty toward each other and plotted against each other and altogether Remington Philips and his own teams were all heavily infected with dark trio and dark hearted values and ideologies and evil and were deemed to dangerous to be allowed or able to exist in this universe and therefore had to be replaced by those I call elves and their kind in acts of well-justified and carefully determined justice who have had to take their [Remington Philips and his teams and those with him] places and their identities and take control of runaway failsafes that should not have been in his hands [he, referring to the original Remington Philips before he was replaced with an exosolar being with a soldier class operation as an act of justice, was misidentified as a civilian and ordinary college student at Tri-C and so-called innocent].  The original Remington Philips should not have been considered for a chosen and cannot be a chosen for the Book Of Faces as he also time-traveled in acts of extreme evil in and out of one realm and another and accross more than one multi-verse and 'more than one cosmic leaf' according to one elf.  Also, for the record I did not choose for aforementioned original Remington Philips [who thankfully doesn't exist anymore] to have any such superpowers/esoterics/failsafes/magics/psychic-abilities in his hands and did not know he had such placed in his hands or under his control and if I had known that such was being done or even considered I would not have wanted or approved at all of such things.  This is another way of saying that I wouldn't have wanted that.  I was also blindsided and misled in that no one told me or involved me and this was deliberate on the part of others as well as an act of deliberate and knowing evil on the part of others according to zarakite values.  At least some exosolars were lied to and misled and also victimized just the same.  The muskrats are one.  Them being lied to and manipulated and decieved as well as victimized in other ways [including time and space being shoved off-kilter and some of their own kind within their families being yanked in and out of existance which was rather shocking and jaw-dropping beyond belief] is no doubt undeniably EVIL beyond belief in an extreme I can't imagine or describe properly and unforgivable as well as unforgettable and this is all according to any and all set of zarakite values that is and ever will be with any and all updates and corrections regardless of any involvement of any immortal as I see it and true and honest and correct for forever and a day.

Idea #0621:
	Sky boys that sting, such as half zarakites and zarakites with five or less heads, have natural secretions from the skin/body-skin of their penis tips and shafts that are involuntarily and automatically secreted.  This odorless and colorless transparent fluid is like sweat and doesn't drip and is part of the natural moisture of their penises, and when Earth-origin animal life [including archaics as well as non-sentients such as deer and wolves etc] touch or otherwise come into contact with this moisture such life experiences near-instantaneous loss of feeling and sensation in whatever part of their body makes contact.  This is so that when such a dragon sky boy goes hunting and stings wildlife, their prey do not experience pain of any kind.  The effect is near instantaneous, and given how fast a dragon sky boy's penis shape-shifts to extend it's length like an arrow shot through the air from a professional bow and arrow [which is quick and swift and too fast for the eyes and penetrates wood, and not any dumb silly backyard kid toy stuff where you can actually see the arrow fly because it moves so slow and it has to be fired in an upwards arc because of gravity, etc], and their penis continues to push it's way through the internal anatomy of their prey at a very high speed and twist around corners and such like a snake, moving around bones and tendons and ligaments as it does, while at other times intelligently making fast decisions where the dragon sky boy's penile brain decides to shapeshift the end of the penis rapidly something like a drill bit so that it drills holes in bones and tough organic tissues with high speed and torque, the prey of a dragon sky boy might feel a brief split-second of pain, but if so it would be so short-lived that they really wouldn't feel or remember pain as the dragon sky boy's penis numbs the tissues and muscles and other parts of the creature being stung, even if such means fatal injury that would still kill the creature shortly.  The target creature being stung won't feel pain or discomfort from being unable to breath or from any cardiac issues, if the penis destroys the creatures ability to breath etc, depending on what it punches holes through and what it shreds and drills holes through as far as the target creatures internal organs and body parts and organic tissues go.  Archaics that are stung often don't experience or remember much or any pain or discomfort from being stung and turned into an ancient, from any part of the process including the end when they are reborn and standing and talking and just starting to get used to their new bodies and youthfulness and health and sex drive and other things about their new bodies and selves that are astounding and feel far better than anything they have ever felt before or had experience with in their entire lives, including how clear-headed they feel and alive and awake and alert and how easy is is for them to think and have extreme comfort with their new selves and love and enjoy all of it, things they always enjoy and like and actually never fully get used to or bored with, for the rest of their lives, including as hybrids and as sky children.  They never feel they would ever want to go back to being any sort of archaic, of any gender or skin color or age or type, athletic or otherwise, and can't imagine ever doing such a repulsive and nasty thing.  Zare doesn't want and didn't want them to die during the process of becoming an ancinet, or a hybrid or sky child which happens later, or experience pain or discomfort, and instead have pleasure and like and enjoy themselves and what they experience, including their new personalities and bodies and sex drives and how they all work.  Zare is big on pleasure, remember?  Yes, Zare is a god of teengae boy-hood of sorts, and an almighty penile sex drive, magical and immortal, legendary, and having fun and pleasure and sex, and what archaics of past centuries would call demented and perverted in many ways, but he likes pleasure and hates pain, and loves to have fun, and be playful, and hates the idea of being anything like archaics that would 'grow up' as they called it and put on any sort of necktie [for, uh, anything, even for a school yearbook photo] and no longer want to go to any teenage parties or 'hang out' and instead feel to old for such things and want to focus on carrers and family and wife and kids and other related crap that Zare never wants to get into and always hates and would never want no matter what, and all of that shit is dark trio and dark hearted anyways, corrupted and infected and evil as fuck as zarakite values will just about always see it.  Anyways, Zare also hates pain, and wouldn't even put up with having to pump iron or go exercise to get nice washboard abs that happen naturally and arn't anything that anyone has to work at to have, and they are still natural muscles that are healthy and not artificial or implants or from any machine or surgery or any other related evil crap.  That and eating as many chocolates and sweets and burgers and pizza as you want and being unable to gain weight and unable to no longer have such abs or at least a 'flat front' [skinny, skin and bones, no belly when relaxing the gut, no need to 'hold in' one's gut or belly in the sightest either, and it's not like any pushing out of the chest is ever involved either so geez guys what the fuck is up with failsafe teams that still come up with people sucking in their bellies and making their chests get bigger?  That's just not right, and still obnoxious, and still shouldn't be there.  I asked for that to be fixed a long time ago and more than once and was told that failsafe teams listened to me and would do that.  I was lied to.  The chest and chest bones, AGAIN, should NOT be enlarged or made bigger, especially front-to-back, not naturally in any relaxed state and not by habit, and people won't be walking around like that all the time either, and shouldn't, so cut it out already!  I think the 'strutting your stuff' shit along with related 'pride' and 'arrogance' crap has AGAIN gone too far, yikes.  Paul S Reeves had that type of arrogance, although he really was proud to strut his stuff and look at his body parts and also in the mirror at himself, though he did it over his stocky and brawny body with rather large muscles, and was big on having a curvature of the spine and even would as a habit exaggerate that, and having wide shoulders, and bodybuilder muscles, and seemed to also liken himself to Conan the Barbarian and Arnold Schwartzenegger before he got really old, and be proud of it and like to show it off wherever he went as well as to himself in his own mirror when he has his own home in Monroe Falls as well as any mirror etc].  Note that sky boys as well as ancients and hybrids don't have to work for the muscles they have, and eat whatever and however much they want, and don't like or want to get into any futile and useless 'no pain no gain' crap which won't change their muscle sizes or their health anyways and as such really is pointless and a waste of time, as well as silly because it won't do anything, and isn't anything to be proud of really.  The only exceptions to all of this is the fact that sky boys as well as archaics and hybrids can have one of five muscle sizes, although again changing muscle sizes and of course speed as a result is not from exercise or working out or diet but instead for different reasons that don't involve the slightest bit of 'no pain no gain' or any philisophical 'if it doesn't kill you it makes you stronger, so pick up the dumbell and get on the exercise bike and get moving!' crap which is dark trio and well favored and cherished and loved by Paul S Reeves over the years who backs such and lives by such over the years and centuries and millienia, among other things.  Anyways, when a dragon sky boy stings an archaic, the stuff with the penis of the dragon sky boy and the lack of pain and discomfort still applies, just like with non-sentients that they hunt and eat for their carnivore diet when they don't have any pizza or cooked food or other stuff that ancients and hybrids and various sky boys like and enjoy.  The exception is that with non-sentients the dragon sky boy penis eats the brain tissue and kills their prey, and with archaics their penis envelops and surrounds the brain and spinal cord and actually isolates it from the rest of what is no longer really their body anymore [plus this process kills their body, so they don't want it back anyways unless they want to eat some of it or leftovers the dragon sky boys might share with the ancient the archaic becomes or something], and without pain or discomfort to both he ancient as well as the dragon sky boy [actually pleasure instead, for the dragon sky boy in particular as he feels like he is ejaculating, and the archaic doesn't feel any pain or stress or LSD experience or dizzyness or headache or anything as Zare wouldn't tolerate that type of stuff anyways].  The archaic's brain, without death as any archaic would normally and naturally ever experience it [they might even keep their name and legal identity and still have the right to the same vehicle and home and property and siblings and family they had when before they were stung, and have all their stuff and also bank accounts as an ancient, something still desired and considered although as usual I'm little and I know I don't get everything I want but I haven't found out where this one is going], is tethered at some point during this stinging process so that they are to later end up being 'reborn' as an ancient [although 'reborn' here doesn't mean death and afterlife and then reincarnation as most Earth origin animal life would normally go through, so the word still has special meaning here as I thought was already established and documented for some time, and I've used the word 'reborn' this special way a number of times and starting more than six months or so ago and probably longer].  After this the penis shapeshifts again to turn back into a normal penis shape and deflates into a 'trophy' as dragon sky boys call it [such is a slang term for the deflated penis they have after stinging, and is used for ejaculating 'frosting' which is what come out instead of milk if their penis tip is sucked on and maybe squeezed [?] and such is still cloudy], and the dragon sky boy can then pull their deflated penis out of the corpse of the archaic's/ancient's/archaic-who-is-now-an-ancient's dead body that isn't his any longer and is freshly killed prey as far as the dragon boy's natural instincts see it, with the red blood of such corpse of course on various parts of the dragon boy's trophy.  The dragon sky boy then has a responsibility to give birth to the ancient, and he has more than one way to do this, including giving birth to the ancient's head and body together and all at once and like how he gives birth to a half zarakite if he were a zarakite and also the same way he gives birth to an expendable such as a 'zero' as well as a 'blond-haired expendalbe' if he is a zarakite.  [I was just told that 'and what have you' as well as 'and what not' are polluted and probably shouldn't be used again, for now.]

Idea #0622:
	Regarding the pleasures of stinging, dragon sky boys have a special exception to stinging felines.  Yes, the sensations involved include what feels like ejaculation and the usual pleasures, but at the same time also come with an ominous feeling a dragon sky boy doesn't normally feel which creeps up and gets progressively bigger and brings with it a natural guilty concious and and related feeling of panic and being distraught that it gradually turns into along with an eventual 'shit, what have I done?' and 'I know I'm not going to get away with this.....' that invariably inenvitably happens no matter how old or skilled or grown up the dragon sky boy is and no matter what face he has or what personality he normally has that comes with it.  Even the most shameless dragon sky boys get weird about this type of thing afterwards if they try to hide it.  Some who don't ever cringe or get anxious start acting unlike themselves as they normally are.  Stinging felines is of course, as if a reminder is needed, sacrilege and evil according to zarakite values, unholy and unjust as such.  This is serious and not something that leaves any dragon sky boy or any feline bemused, or what would leave any feline creature [of planet Earth in origin of course] bemused if such were proposed in a hypothethical and the feline were made to be sentient.  Note that Zare hates the idea of felines being forced to be sentient to put up with any of what they have experienced on planet Earth, and would take such evil seriously, and so would his zarakite values.  This of course applies to any Zare of SkyCrowne and any immortal of planet Earth and all sky boys as well, and simply makes sense, 'nuffs said.

	Note that 'dvd shrink' is illegal software in the USA and many other nations as well for human-beings/archaics, and USA citizens who are archaic human beings are not legally allowed to own or download or upload or host such software.  It was downloaded from sourceforge dot net from the 'scorchcrafter' project which hosts projects and files for public Internet access world-wide without any login or account or money required to do such things for archaic humans beings as well as my own kind [at least at present].  The download was from someone from Poland October 1st 2019 CE [2019-10-01].  It was also downloaded from someone in the USA October twenty-second 2019 Common Era [2019-10-22].  From when I first uploaded it to my project [ScorchCrafter] on 2019-08-19 until now and I presume onward I have not recieved any emails or phone calls or notices of any kind from sourceforge or any law enforcement from any nation anywhere regarding the zip archive file I'm talking about or any takedown notices or any shutdown of my project on Sourceforge or Sourceforge dot net itself and I have not had any complaints from anyone anywhere of any nation regarding this as well as any other uploads that might be illegal software or intellectual property [Copyright] violations, at all whatsoever including anyting regarding games or music or music videos.  No one has charged me with any crime ever since I started uploading stuff like this to any project on sourceforge or youtube or Google or anywhere else for anyone worldwide to download, from anywhere, and people from all over not just the USA but plenty of other nations including Russia and Japan and Euroupe and even places like Pakistan and Arab nations etc have been downloading these things.  Huh.  No one from any of the nursing staff or any of the Reeves family or dark trio or dark hearted or any doctor or any legal guardian or anyone who lives in the nursing home I live in have mentioned or brought up any of these things or seem to care or see this as any sort of concern for myself or anyone else.  That includes lawyers and attorneys [same thing] and any of my Chosen/Originals as well.  No one has warned me to not continue doing this type of thing and no one has called me on any telephone regarding such and no one has made conversation [mentioned it in any conversation of their own initiative] with me or where I have overheard or eavesdropped on anyone or anything.  Go figure.  BTW [By The Way, an acronym], I'm still waiting to hear back from my chosen, and haven't heard back from Steve Schlaf or Brendan Kilbane etc although to be fair I recently sent them messages and expect it would take time for them to reply by phone or email or drive over and say hi or something.  [This nursing home accepts visitors for residents like myself night and day twenty-four 365 although they prefer that they be notified when visitors stop over at night or outside of usual preferred visiting hours I guess.]  Yes I take phone calls and the direct number to my bedroom that bypasses any nursing staff is still a landline with the number (330) 836-7953.  That's area code 330 which is Fairlawn Ohio in the greater Akron Ohio area and my direct land line phone number has been clearly available and visible as such for the whole world to see and download from any long and verbose 'readme.txt' file that is on a number of sourceforge dot net project web pages as well as other locations.  No one has threatened me with going to any locked unit or hospital or inpatient facility or more medication or other more restrictive or harsh conditions at this nursing home or any other unfair harsh evil conditions or punishments of any kind including any spiritual and vilification and karmic and esoteric stuff and psychic as well over these issues and I don't think anyone will or can.  This simply makes sense.  I also remember when the Japanese government back when I still was living in Victoria Plaza Apartments in North Olmsted a 19 floor high-rise right at Great Northern Mall issued me diplomatic immunity and other related paperwork and credentials and accepted me as such for some program I'm still unfamiliar with and was supposed to be educated by failsafes about including a guy named Brian and a guy named Steve probably as well as other people who I could embarass who have really been dipshits at times although such has come and gone and there's more than meets the eye to this as well as Joe Amato and his group and his experience in the US Air Force and the fact that I know as a fact that police departments in the USA or at least the state of Ohio will out of being professional defer a report or case to the US Air Force if they have reason to believe that extraterrestrials [aliens, as in beings from outer space and outside the edge of this Solar System or at least planet Mars or Venus, duh] are involved.  By the way I think of aforementioned extraterrestrials when I hear the word 'alien' and presume that's what someone is talking about when I hear or read that word somewhere, like the Steven Spielberg movie 'ET' with the archaic human character 'Elliot' and the being from his crashed spaceship that would say 'ET Phone Honme' and raise a glowing finger and also levitate and do other esoteric stuff, although early telpathic guides sure had fun and jollies deliberately misinterpreting such as 'foriegn national' and really went to town with being bullies and assholes over that and really got rough and unfair and last time I checked are still getting away with it in too many translators and use it as excuses to involve themselves and call themselves CIA.  They do it in what I think would be called 'exosolar telepathy' as well as 'CIA telepathy' and quite frankly I'm not familiar with either one and never got any introduction or instructions or proper help to either one actually and was supposed to get help and assistance learning exosolar telepathy but instead someone deliberately gave it to me in 'spy talk' and then put something in place so that I would not ever get it explained to me in any language that I would understand and instead would continue to be clueless and accused of being something that I'm not [the word 'spy' comes to mind and seems to be among their favorite taunts and they keep repeating it over the last several years ever since the Type Five with jeers and malicious taunting like bullies that do much more than steal lunch money and actually belong in jail and have been too unfair and I have heard this shit in my head literally every day for more than several years straight and no of course I've nevef had spirits or telepathy in my head beforehand and others have a hell of a lot to explain if maybe, just maybe, I'm being literally honest and just in case someone should actually consider that as well as the fact that all three of my immediate family Paul and Sally and Martin all grew up with sprits and telepathy and 'spy hubs' or whatever they are called in their heads from birth and their whole lives and meanwhile I did not and never heard of such things and lived three and a half decades this way without have ever hearing of such things knock on wood and just MAYBE this is all honest and might have some credibility to it].  I guess I'll also mention that someone else who was a candidate for being an Original and then dropped was unfamiliar with the telepathy in his head and ended up calling his local police department freaking out not knowing what was going on but not wanting to sound crazy or like someone who went nuts and end up being diagnosed as mentally ill.  I've also picked up that most who don't know what the telepathy is wonder if it is some kid with a smartphone that has some weird app on it that gets into someone's head although I'm being realistic when I say that I've never heard of such a thing and don't think there is any such thing and I've never worked with any police officers or had any cop friends who told me about such a thing and I'd think they would be skeptical such a thing exists just like myself.  By the way, my advice, after what I've been through, is to trust muskrats including those who won't necessarily be kahjeet [I still want to save their planet and keep their planet intact as it is and as such I'm not expecting all of them to be kahjeet and not stay as they are to begin with and I haven't forgotten that promise as well as related want and desire and I don't make empty promises the way any of the three of the dark trio do and I never learned to bluff at least as Proto] as well as elves including Dylan and those that they endorse as not all of them I'm expecting to be elven sky boys of course in much the same way as muskrats and kahjeet of course.  Also the solar wyvrens have been involved for a long time and are staunch allies, and for some time have figured out ways to recover from being infected that no one else apparently made work, and so did muskrats that are going to be kahjeet, and elves that are going to be elf sky boys.  [I've been using the label 'elves' for creatures that are not from Earth that are misnomer placeholder terms for lack of better terms, and still have other types involved that don't have names in any English that I'm familiar with, and English is what I know.]  Also trustworthy the same and consistent and rock solid the ENTIRE TIME is the Celestial Bear as I call him, at least for now, which isn't from this galaxy or this universe, and has been a worthy and reliable staunch ally the entire time who has long been familiar with the original dark queen including long before Earth existed.  He and his kind include many that are from another universe that can be reached from the universe I'm in that includes my home planet Earth [unfortunately, as it is messed up, this really is embarassing now for me and Earth which is still in great almighty pain I'm sure] and starting from my home planet get in a space ship that is superphotonic [faster-than-light, I learned it from a video game, actually read the manual and paid attention to the plotline and dialouge and got into it as well as learned ways to navigate a spiral galaxy by using words such as 'coreward' and 'outward' and 'upspin' and 'downspin' and they also had a 'galactic North' I think but of course they take into consideration that if flipped upside-down then 'upspin' and 'downspin' are of course in opposite directions duh] and keep going in such a superphotonic spacecraft not just outside of my home galaxy but also outside of my galactic cluster and then outside of my galactic supercluster and then outside of my galactic filament and probably through one or more voids [humans you should look up this stuff on the wikipedia under astronomy articles what a 'galactic filament' is and what a 'void' is on that scale] and then go far beyond where the big bang for my universe ever got to with it's expanding nature and travel through a LOT of empty space and then reach another universe with it's own galactic filaments and structure or whatever as I actually never asked the guy what his universe is like even though he's been a good longtime buddy and so I'm not sure exactly what types of solar systems and such he has over there but anyways with all of these mind readers left and right I'm being told I should try to protect him.  Also I don't know what direction his home is in and I can use a traditional fold-out paper map that archaic humans invented and fits in a pocket and can be unfolded accross the entire hood of a car [as in gasoline-powered infernal contraption that just HAD to break down in the middle of nowhere or the middle of a busy intersection in the middle of a left-hand turn dammit] and actually read one of those maps and fold it back up [actually it's easy because you don't have to fold it up the same way hint hint and now a bunch of yawn-worthy 'mockers' and stand-up comedian personalities will I'm sure have fun using that as a springboard so knock yourself out a---holes] although I don't know of any fold-out maps that would show galactic filaments as well as individual stars and planets with details as I'm sure they don't sell any of those on Earth for drivers for practical reasons.  I also know mapquest and Google maps and the old advice they tell humans with their computers 'use the Google my friend use the Google' or whatever much like 'trust the force Luke' although to be honest I haven't actually tried looking up maps of that size and extent for any smartphone or laptop with any search engine.  By the way, if you are stuck talking to the CIA, try to get 'CIA Gary' or whatever is left of him as he's a vessel and he's been well supported although he's really not the first choice one should use to go to and he gets busy.  It isn't easy as I know that species can become mind controlled by evil and turned into evil bad guys and become hostiles and they can be of any species just like humans looking at history books in school when they are little know that there are good humans and bad humans just by how wars break out and also how some end up in jail and drugs and gangs and good ones never get into any of that stuff and at least try to stay away from all of that and also hate all of that evil crap.
	Note that this list also includes the old DOS game 'Zone 66' which was downloaded 2019-09-10 by someone in Germany and 2019-10-23 by someone from the USA.  It has an amazing intro soundtrack with a very good emulation of an electric guitar and drums and synths along with the animae cartoon introduction.  You can save yourself the headaches of fussing with a DOS emulator and DOSBOX and other related hassle by simply looking up the intro with the soundtrack on Youtube or something [like um some other video sharing site as there are plenty] as well as whether or not you'd want to actually try out the game or not [and for the dumb exosolar translators that don't understand English or human cultures too well which is what I 'grew up' with except I'm still little, you can find out if the work involved to get the game running just to hear the soundtrack was actually worth it, as well as the game itself].
	I think 'xcom backup.zip' might actually be old backup copies of the original Microprose XCOM and it's sequel from the 1990s that has in it human soldiers defending themselves against hostile aliens which in some cases have mind control and thought control psionic/psychic abilities, and humans in these video games study and reverse engineer and copycat the alien technology and use that against them, including psi-amps which are thought-control gizmos that posses and mind control opponents and also plasma rifles and super-powerful fighter aircraft that sometimes double as spacecraft.  These run on alien power sources including a fuel not found in the Sol System and depend on this alien power source [not too smart, humans in iD software's DOOM video games kinda did the same thing and didn't think of the consequences, you would think that humans would have learned from these sorts of video games and Raider's Of The Lost Ark with Harrison Ford not to mess with such esoterics and keep their greedy grubby hands off of such things and not get playful and evil with them and start to self-indulge and have too much evil 'fun' with such] and of course all of the stuff humans build in the XCOM game to fight the hostile evil aliens which include mind controllers from various extraterrestrial places are all super-top secret and humans in the game just like in real life are actually easy targets and real suckers for someone else's mind control psychic powers and never see it coming yet think they are hot stuff and can supposedly pull it off on their own and without any other help from another planet.  Hostile mind controllers of course probably love it when a species that is their 'prey' or their targets decide to make their efforts top secret as their easily mind controlled victims [humans in this case] can be easily compromised and turned into workers for the hostile evil mind controllers, and do so in top secret ways which the humans set up and really did themselves in with, and if any of the human victim survivors run for it and try to regroup no one takes them seriously because of how top secret their efforts are and if any other human they could go to for help is top secret and doesn't have a uniform and public office then those humans can't even figure out who their own co-workers who are not compromised and turned into hostiles are and at best run accross who they think MIGHT be allies and soldiers like themselves but are actually hostiles that are pretending to still be allies that were never mind controlled and anyone else such as a police officer thinks they are crazy and mentally ill and talking 'crazy talk' with discussing such things and so they can't find their own allies or squadmates and can't identify themselves to each other in any town or city and they die and all suffer and never make it and the whole planet gets to 'planetfall' status because of logic and how things work in real life and what types of things just do and don't work realistically to survive any alien invasion of one's planet.  That and because any short-lived survivors insist on secrecy and things such as mind controllers and hostile psychics are so secretive that no normal police officer takes it seriously and instead thinks someone 'needs help' if they talk about suchy things the survivors don't trust each other and any trust falters and comes and goes and they all end up fighting each other and sick of each other which is how things work in real life in this universe and is common logic that leads to what usually happens on a planet such as planet Earth and is what is realistic and expected to likely happen and simply makes sense.  As a side note the original Paul S Reeves loves it when his opponents fight each other and he actually sets up his victims and enemies to do that.  Note that Paul S Reeves is not one of the Chosen and never was, and as such never was and never will be an Original, and 'original' and 'Original' are not the same thing.  The capitalized one refers to the Chosen and The Book Of Faces and the lowercase one refers to how it is in a common archaic human dictionary and sorry but I'm not an English major and never graduated with any college degree of any sort from anywhere and I make typos and grammar mistakes all the time, and all of this still continues to simply make sense.

Idea #0624:
	Speaking of zarakite values, I don't come from any downtown ghetto or high-crime background or lifestyle and never did, and I instead came from an archaic human culture where people would call the cops [as in local police department] when they suspect someone is doing something and trust their local police officers and rely on them as a casual and normal thing.  I did not come from any high-crime upbringing or whatever where no one would ever call the cops or be paranoid and think 'if you call the cops you go to jail' as a matter-of-fact thing like Matthew Damron and Ron Marchie who grew up and learned from their cultures that when someone does something that breaks rules you look the other way and don't ever dare tell on them and actually end up doing the same stuff they do and break laws and everyone by the time they are too old for high school has stolen a car and gotten into street drugs and takes it as a given.  Matthew Damron and Ronald Marchie both came from that evil crap and a 'lie cheat and steal' thing as a way of life and actually think that rules are meant to be broken and have actual literal jaw-dropping pride in being anti-establishment and 'middle finger' towards authority and love being assholes and actually brag about that as well as believe in a paranoid 'no one dare ever snitch' meaning no one ever dare call any police or authority when things happen and then everyone left and right is a thug where they live.  Both of them told me they grew up in that type of thing although different versions of it [Ron Marchie was Polish and grew up in a high-crime 'Slavic village' of some sort in the Greater Cleveland Area or nearby and Matthew Damron is also a white guy who grew up who knows where but in a high crime childhood where everyone is poor and African American and Matthew was actually always very racist with really sick 'nigger' jokes that leave me speechless behind their backs and at the same time would befriend African Americans left and right and manipulate and con them out of one thing after another as a parasite and hoodrat and thug of some sort while Ron Marchie also had to get along with being surrounded by African Americans who were high-crime and very dangerous thugs and he did so as a minority and had to survive and both he and Matthew told me plenty of stories in my apartment and their apartments over the years as well as around the apartment building while Ron Marchie had a psychiatric anxiety disorder and would get scared and nervous and paranoid easily and quickly and took medications for it over the years and admitted it and would make conversation of it among his stories and also he was unfortunately a drunk who really had serious alchohol problems as well as his anxiety and paranoia by archaic human standards].

Idea #0625:
	Between August of 1983 and the start of the school year of 1984 the family moved from Galveston Texas to Herndon Virginia.  I started kindergarten or first grade in Herndon Virginia and can't quite remember what the most correct information is regarding that.  I remember the first grade teacher I had was a Negro man named Mister Byrd and he was a really nice guy and he baked cookies for the class the very first day of classes.  The classroom had it's own bathroom as well, I remember.  Jonathan Lee was also in that class.  Ms Pitt, by the way was a lady I had for second grade.  I also remember Nick Sealy and Kevin Benco and Kevin [something, his name is currently being flummoxed, and a few minutes ago I would remember it just fine, but as of right now I'm not expecting to remember it ever again, the same thing that happened to Billy Zegas's classmate who had red hair and I used to remember his name quick and easy all the time for well over a decade after 1996 and high school was long over, and now I don't have a prayer of remembering his name again and the artificial amnesia from another ZAP that I just got slammed with caused permanant loss of the memory of his name.  I do however STILL remember that he had red hair and did NOT typically dress like a girl and he did NOT act like a girl and he was NOT gay and I did NOT remember him or masterbate over him EVER as any sort of 'girl' or looking like he was wearing any sort of dress, EVER, but instead as the BOY he was and dressed like a boy when dressed, thank you very much, and remembered him as I described and NOT as any mocker or grab bag dark trio zealot idiot still wants to render him as a girl which he WASN'T, instead I remembered him MY WAY as a GUY who is something called MALE you assholes so get used to it because I remembered him dressing like a MALE long after high school as well as during such so SUCK MY DICK AND GET USED TO IT I REMEMBER HIM AS A BOY AND NOT A GIRL YOU DARK TRIO EVIL SHITHEADS WHO ARE NEVER GOING TO BE WITH ME AND ARE PERPETUATING MORE OF THE OLD DARK TRIO AND HOSTILES THAT ARE EVIL AND WANT TO KILL ALL LIFE IN THIS UNIVERSE WITH YOUR GIRLY FEMALE EVIL RENDERS OF HIM THAT ARE DARK TRIO AND CRIMINAL.  Zarkite values agree with ME and NOT your asshole renders and this will always never be untrue and this will always simply make sense.  The zarakite sex drive will always agree with ME and NOT any girl-like evil sh-- and what I say will never be untrue and this will always still make sense.  Gosh, maybe someone is once again corrupt and needs to be shot for treason, and perhaps given the electric chair over this, ya think?  Girl-like and dress-wearing renders are evidence to imprison and condemn those who created and perpetuated aforementioned representations of him and are going to be used at the trials and court martials of one or more individuals according to what I was just told and notified of and this is well justified and also zarakite values-compliant and needs to be done as acts of justice and stopping criminal corruption and simply makes sense.  Zarakite values don't tolerate aforementioned corruption or criminal behavior and neither do I, and this applies to all values of every immortal that ever will be of any planet Earth that had me or any David A Reeves born on it and all of this will never be untrue or incorrect or dishonest.  This type of aforementioned corruption and criminal stuff isn't going to be subject to forgiveness or pardon of any sort by any government or any justice system or values of any zarakite tribe or zarakite values and otherwise wouldn't be tolerated by any Zare of any SkyCrowne or any Tiger's Eye Jade SwiftWing ever.  Zarakites and zarakite values don't bluff or make empty promises and can't with this sort of thing, as anything else would be dark trio and Sally Lynn Reeves at least made empty promises and lies about this sort of thing all the time over the decades and no zarakite or any zarakite values could ever sink to her level as it would be too dangerous and too irresponsible and too evil and I know I'm correct and I know that ever backing down on this later even if some claim it was a joke of some sort would be too dangerous and would bring in more hostile mind controllers of very dangerous natures and more psychic exosolar mental illness to not just planet Earth but this entire universe and also more than such.  All of this will always still will continue to simply make sense.  A speical hint from my guides also notified me that aforementioned crininal dark hearted behavior, perpetuating any female and-or dress wearing reperesentations of aforementioned red-haired chosen, is associated with the old Matthew Damron and his criminal and evil behaviors and corruption-favoring personality and may be from his group or team or old co-workers.].

Idea #0626:
	Between the end of the school year 1989 when I finished 5th grade and the start of the school year in 1989 when I started 6th grade the family moved from Herndon Virginia to North Olmsted Ohio.  I had all of my 5th grade year at Hutchison Elementary Grade School and all of my sixth grade school year at North Olmsted Junior High School.  I remember Joe Amato and the caterpillar outside of North Olmsted Junior High School the first day or one of the first few days of classes for 6th grade when he said hi to me and was talking about the caterpillar and I recall the entrance was between the parking lot and the side building I didn't have any classes in.  I also remember the parking lot is actually where the 6th grade hallways were and were two hallways one on the frist floor and one on the second floor.  David Frindt was also a student in the same sixth grade back then and the same classes and I remember in those hallways for the sixth graders a few humans left and right of David Frindt ragging on Dave and calling him 'Frindt-head' among a few dumb jokes.  [It may have been 'Frint-head' as David Frindt's last name was always pronounced 'Frindt' with the 'd' being silent when spoken out loud.]  I also remember Joe Amato and I had lunch at the same time during sixth grade and I think I remember him being tall and skinny sitting next to other humans left and right of him at the lunch table he sat at or at least very skinny [he was always skinny and whatever he did with his health it worked].  We actually didn't end up sitting at the same lunch table and also I for some reason didn't end up learning his last name for a while [I would be like 'Hey, there's that guy, who said I to me when I had the caterpillar, and I want to say hi to him and learn his name, and make new friends at this school, and ZZZAAAAPP!!!! weird fuzzy thinking..... cloudy thinking, can't think straight, sleepy, head fogged up and lightheaded, ughhhhh..... and, uh, wait..... what day is it?.....  Huh..... Um, oh, right, I'm at lunch..... okay, what was I in the middle of.....  Okay, and..... Oh, hey, there's that guy, who met me outside of - ZZZZZAAAPPPPP!!!!  Ugh.....  What the.....  Um, what, uh, what's the..... wait, what's my name?..... wait, where am I, am I - Oh, right, I'm at school, and I'm, uh, I guess I'm at lunch..... um..... Okay, what's this taste like anyways?  Okay, I'm about ready to 'enjoy' the taste of it a second time coming right back up, ugh.....]  [Hey look, this s--- didn't just happen to me, it happened to poor Joe as well, like when we were both in Phys Ed class and walking out of the locker room at almost the same time, when the poor guy was stuttering and his voice got bend upwards into outer space and he sounded like a damn Asperger, and Joe NEVER talks like that, including stuttering, EVER, geez, I'm surprised the poor human still made it out of the locker room and the rest of the way down that short hallway and into the gym, yikes.  Look, I know how, uh, 'popular' humans are in at least this universe, but Joe is MINE and my dick agrees with me, so we're just going to put up with me and my sex drive being a pain in the ass about this, with him and a number of the chosen.  Yes, I know planet Earth is also sick of humans, but I've decided to be pushy and stick with it, and we all might as well get used to it, puke-worthy as it is, and at least I'm being honest and not bulls---ting about it.]  [The same ZAP s--- by the way happened to both me and Steve Schlaf simultaneously when we were in Speech class, as normally I wouldn't stare down the poor guy's shirt like that, although normally I wouldn't be slammed by some psychic and hypnotic skynet-like or thought-control-like whatever that would make me pass out keeling over bending forward and stun my brain left and right in all places, and leave me with my penis and my hormones to do the thinking instead.  That's of course not normal for me or a species like what Steve and Joe are, yikes.  I'm glad he was able to walk out of the classroom and into the parking lot later, and if we weren't both still getting over it, I'd have my head thinking a little less up and I would be scared for Steve to drive himself home and not just walk straight, and then there's the other stuff that his kind deal with like heart attacks and other human stuff, ugh.....].

Idea #0627:
	Evil, the dark hearted, and the dark trio don't know how to have fun, and hate fun and pleasure as it is for planet Earth and all life of planet Earth.  Zarakite values as well as The Zarakite Sex Drive and will to live as it is for all life of planet Earth both intelligent and otherwise are all altogether with planet Earth and all against the dark trio [and the dark trio's dark hearted of course] and their values on this one.  This has never been untrue throughout Earth's history including before Earth had AIR with OXYGEN in it to now and still going strong and for forever and a day.  No Tiger's Eye Jade SwiftWing that I or any immortal of planet Earth sees in any reflection could or would ever want to believe or feel or think otherwise.  Or claim or say, for that matter, when being honest and straight and not being 'teenager' about it like with a smarta-- sarcastic joke or whatever.....  Zarakites are magical and are of nature and of Earth.  Zarakites are also dragons and majestic and youthful and fun-lovingly playful and male-gender-penis-driven-hormone-inspired at times as such.  They have natures that embrace fertility and sex and pleasure and can be quite 'ejaculatory' about it as some of their schoolteachers put it.

Idea #0628:
	Archaic humans shouldn't castrate themselves or cut off their penises or their testicles.  They have de-evolved and can't handle that and are too disconnected from their world's nature to even begin to be able to do that properly.  They should let the zarakites and their sky boys do that type of thing and take care of them.  Well, geez, they detach their penises and reattach them and share them all the time, and don't even need testicles between their legs anyways, looking at their hormones, I would think they know what they are doing, and they certainly know how to manage other species of their planet and have the natural instincts and intuition to do that.  That and they do so without inducing pain or suffering or actually injuring or harming those that they do these types of things to in any way that anyone they manage like that would care about.  They also know how to make it fun and pleasure so that people enjoy it and so does nature with the indirect long-term results that accumulate.  [This is awful.  I hate trying to describe it and having it come out like this.  A proper TigerStone faced zarakite dragon would probably call me a dork or something and describe it a lot better I would think.]  They also do this in very real ways that don't involve surgery or being put under anesthesia in some operating room of any kind and instead do this type of stuff when people are wide awake and enjoying it and are clear-thinking and don't have any foggy weird plastic zapping shooting through their head bouncing between their ears.  That and they don't incude headaches but actually take away headaches and stress and pain and foggy thinking instead with the way they do this and other stuff to people as well as themselves.  The fact that these magical dragons called zarakites themselves don't lie down and sleep or get drowsy or drunk and hate that stuff anyways is also a big hint.  Zarakites also manage their own body parts themselves as well as that of others casually and in the middle of unrelated conversations and humor and even absent-mindedly so and do this as a regular and normal thing that human beings will find they get used to and really enjoy once they experience it for the very first time [although before the first time understandably are a bit nervous and squeamish and understandably scared s---less beforehand.  Look, zarakites understand how and why humans get nervous and scared before they experience them the first time, as I see it.  They also can be anywhere between caring and gentle and raunchy and wisecracking and everywhere in-between about it but even the ones that seem to take the least serious-minded attitude about it and seem like a wild raunchy teenager being joking actually care in some way but don't show it and really do know what they are doing and afterwards tend to rag on humans about how they are fine and actually enjoy what happened and are actually playing a joke on the human and pranking them nothing more nothing less.  There are reasons that other dragon sky boys might say things like 'Don't worry, I know it seems like so-and-so dragon is being a raunchy teenager who seems like he's making fun of you and is having fun with you, but he's actually not bullying you and when you let him work with you you'll find he actually knows what he's doing and he's actually taking really good care of you and he's not actually going to victimize you.  That and if something does go wrong he actually would get super-serious all of the sudden and really fight to save your life even though he's not some paramedic or anything.  He's like that and gets super-serious like that even if you're in pain or something starts to hurt because he knows it shouldn't and even if he doesn't seem like it you can actually just tell him about something mild and trivial that you think might bother him and even though he and what he's going to do to you, human, might seem intimidating he's actually going to get serious if he has to and he actually does take you and any pain you shouldn't have very seriously.'  I can see Tiger's Eye Jade SwiftWing and TigerStone faced zarakites more or less being like that or at least I think I can.  All Zarakites are actually very altruistic warriors and heros and world-savers by nature and in actuality, although some of them such as TigerStone's have their playful wisecracks and sarcasm and smartass humor about it and wouldn't tolerate ever being dorks or technical or stoic about it and would hate to be boring, but their adolescent humor and playfulness is really superficial as they actually do take threats to life and civilization and nature and innocent life of all worlds very seriously and very stubbornly and are very dedicated to enforcing those types of things and never tolerating letting crime or corruption or anarchy take over or get too bad, even though they don't have a reputation for describing it or talking about it too seriously or like any 'grown-up' would.  All dragon sky boys are also known for their sex drives and hormones and their penises making it into discussions one way or another and have quite a reputation for those types of things.  They just don't all show it the same way.  TigerStone faced dragon boys at least I think I still see taking advantage of how others don't take them seriously and think they are joking when they are actually honest and in some cases even telling others they are honest about what they and some penis of theirs will do, and then prove that they are actually not bluffing and actually do what they said they would, literally.  They actually make an 'honest joke' or 'honest prank' out of it at times, when they don't bother to try to explain it any further honestly, and know that people will be astonished and jaw-dropped when they do it and others find that they actually were not kidding.  TigerStones don't actually smile or laugh at such but have fun and amusement when they do these types of things, and they make others laugh when they watch it happen.  I don't see TigerStones as having to work at it or make effort to not at all smile or laugh when they joke and prank in actually all ways they do such things naturally and also have a natural knack for making other people of other personalities laugh and be impressed and enjoy.  TigerStones don't practice or make deliberate effort or train themselves to be this way and do these things, as I see it.  Their personalities, when they are like this, can be a bit intimidating and 'a bit much' and anything but mellow for those who arn't used to them.  Personalities that don't like pranks and don't like jokes and have no tolerance for humor of such sort and are, as a TigerStone and many sky boys would see it, are uptight and need to 'loosen up' and 'learn to have fun' and 'have no life' and perhaps are hermits and stoics and sit and meditate and are too introverted and wouldn't have gotten laid last night anyways and as such are too introverted and incapable of going out and having fun with others, don't like TigerStone personalities and would hate to put up with socializing with them for very long much less at all and I guess would rather go be a hermit and crawl into a little cramped home and be alone and introverted and probably just sleep and be otherwise useless or whatever.  Look I don't mind creativity and like trying stuff that is brand new and experimenting, and so do TigerStone personalities, but what's the point of doing it as a boring introverted hermit that would never leave home and never show it off to anyone and would never go out and have fun with any of it?  That's a bit more than a waste.  TigerStone faced boys are indeed hot shots at times, although school teachers and soldier class authorities find that they actually are very obedient and just simply follow instructions intelligently and USUALLY without playing dumb when someone simply talks to them and tells them what to do with simple and straightforward instructions that are face to face and verbal and common like in a classroom.  TigerStone personalities are also VERY good at recognizing when others are busy and already occupied with something and shouldn't be bothered or interrupted.  TigerStone personalities would HATE to be a brat or pest or dork or 'annoying little brother dork' of any kind and interrupt someone like that.  They also hate it if friends and family become dorks or brats or annoying like that and care about both their friend/family and also anyone who might be annoyed.  TigerStone personalities are also considerate of how others feel and don't need to be lecutured by anyone with any 'Well how do you think THEY feel.....?' talk by anyone who understands them.  As for those who don't understand them, like the original dark trio king and queen at least were, hint hint, that's another story, one we should be caught up with by now and one I shouldn't have to hold anyone's hand through baby steps with at this point.  TigerStone faced boys, by the way, see anyone who is a dork that also wants to be a dork and-or enjoys being a dork as simply being mentally ill and infected with dark trio with no further consideration needed and this simply makes sense.  TigerStone personalities also lack being anything like homosexual archaic human personalities of all genders irregardless of their sexuality that comes with their species and irregardless of how zarakites have sex with male and female people.  TigerStone personalities naturally hate homosexual archaic personalities of all genders and have to make deliberate effort of self controlling kind to be diplomatic and hide their hatred of such aforementioned.  TigerStone personalities would never want to have personalitiy characteristics like that of a homosexual archaic human of any gender.  TigerStone personalities also see archaic human homosexual personalties as mentally ill and dark trio and infected and unhealthy although not necessarily evil but certainly victimized by evil.  Note that 'personality' when used in these contexts are not the same thing as one's actual species, as zarakites have sex with more than one gender including their own gender but don't naturally develop a 'homosexual' or 'bisexual' pwersonality as an archaic human would see it.]

Idea #0629:
	TigerStone personalities are not limited to any sky boy species exclusively.  TigerStone persoanlities are also not limited to Earth-origin life either and can actually be found in intelligent and sentient life from planets other than planet Earth as well.  TigerStone personalities are youthful adolescent uncouth and playful and practical-joke extroverted physically active personalities that are also very male and very heterosexual and also lack being discreet about sexual behaviors and also lack shame when it comes to casual sexual conversation, all using archaic human personalities as frames of reference and comparison and standards, generally.  TigerStone personalities are also quick and practical socially and the opposite of being socially inept.  TigerStone personalities are also quick-thinking and impulsive and altruistic and quickly jump into action ready to fight agressively and enthusiastically with physical violence and are well-suited personalities that fit a carnivorous predator animal species of planet Earth like a Siberian Tiger and have personalities that wouldn't work with pacifistic or non-physically-aggressive or herbivore life of planet Earth.  TigerStone personalities are attentive and lack gullibility.  TigerStone personalities are attentive and notice things and very alert when it comes to spotting prey for hunting, by Earth origin carnivore animal standards.  TigerStone personalities are socially quick and natural and intuitive and also impulsive and lack dwelling on things for very long when it comes to social skills and are the opposite of 'being out to lunch' like a doof or any dork who 'still doesn't get it'.  TigerStone personalities hate social stupidiy and social ineptness, although when they encounter those types of personalities they don't like to walk away or refuse to associate but instead want to 'do something about it' so that an individual with a socially inept personality [which TigerStone personalities often see as bad in zarakite values especially with Earth origin sentients] no longer has their personality issues and one way or another turns into someone who has a better personality ['better' in this case meaning they no longer have a bad and-or evil and-or infected personality according to zarakite values].  Note that law-breaking and criminal personalities that get into drug dealing and commit felonies, as archaic human USA culture sees it, are evil and bad and also should be hated according to both TigerStone personalities as well as zarakite values.  Any immortal of any planet Earth more than three decades ago never would have disagreed, and this has never changed and never would change for any immortal of any planet Earth, and this simply makes sense.

Idea #0630:
	Zarakites understand enough of the personalities that other sky boys, for purely and invariably mundane reasons, and being from the same world of origin, and being related species and cultures, and how common all one hundred personalities of sky boys are from the Book Of Faces.  Individual sky boys including zarakites as well of course still do have at least subtle variations and differences from person to person when comparing two sky boys with the same face [from the Book Of Faces] and the same type and same clan [and therefore their physical facial features are the same at the same ages and also facial expressions are the same at the same ages and also their choice of words and social skills and likes and dislikes and common slang terms in certain situations and the way their voices sound when they talk the same sort of ways etc are mostly and generally the same at the same ages etc] and so it isn't very difficult in culture and society as a sky boy to figure out how to socialize with most sky boys and also figure out what their likes and dislikes generally are.  This also roots out fakes and imposters and dopplegangers that shape-shift and are not Earth origin that are hostile and pretend and want to invade Earth, as 'everyone knows' what a sky boy with a certain face is expected to be like and what they socialize like and how their pranks and practical jokes and humor and likes and dislikes in video games and sports and music and swordfighting and gunfighting and hunting and sex drive etc.  This roots out possibilities that someone is a victim of mind control as well as thought control and also hypnosis and possession all of ANY sort and makes it very easy to tell if someone is infected by anything psychic in nature.  No one needs to be an expert and all sky boys of all years of age can and will naturally and intuitively pick up on fakes and infected people and spies and very quickly socially 'single out' and identify and react to aforementioned and in some cases identify them as 'dorks' and other misfits and do these types of things in very natural and intuitive and mundane ways the way children and teenagers do naturally and intuitively and without thinking or effort and without any sky boys ever being mind readers or psychics or using divination or scrying or even getting personal with other people or micromanaging or having to snoop around someone else's home or personal belongings to quickly pick up on these types of things.  The original dark trio have NO ways to do this sort of thing and are way out of their league and in over their heads at even starting to study or practice or do any of these types of things and can't compete with how adolescent and teenage ordinary mundane archaic human beings who want to be popular and hate dorks and don't get diagnosed with mental illnesses and are healthy do these things naturally and without being psychic or telepathic and have already done these things for centuries and millenia and this has already been correct and honest and true for the last million years on planet Earth for generally the masses and vast majority of the public and general populations all over the world of all nations.  All sky boys naturally do the same thing, just as natural and just as socially capable and being anything but socially inept.  This is still what any Zare of SkyCrowne as well as zarakite values as well as any immortal that lives in the same realm as planet Earth, altogether and invariably, always would have wanted and desired and tried to make happen and also simultaneously asked for, and always will, and this simply makes sense.  'nuff said.  No David A Reeves found anywhere on or in any planet Earth ever has to read or think about or re-think or remember any of what is in this paragraph for all of it to be invariably correct as well as lacking deception, and this entire paragraph is honest and correct and lacking deceptions irregardless.

Idea #0631:
	Zarakites do not hate magic in any sort of general sense and never would.  To hate magic as any default assumption is invariably un-zarakite-like and is a hatred characteristic of an imposter and fake so-called 'zarakite' of some sort.  Zarakite values agree with this Idea and set of concepts and always will agree, for forever and a day.  No immortal of planet Earth would ever disagree.  This all makes sense.

Idea #0632:
	Zarakites and all sky boys do not at all ever hate the zarakite sex drive.  This always is literal and always is invariably and always simply makes sense.

Idea #0633:
	Zarakites and all sky boys do not at all ever see the zarakite sex drive as evil.  This always is literally invariably a logical concept that always simply makes sense.

Idea #0634:
	All sky boys see pain as being evil with 'evil' always being the opposite of 'good' of course.  Zarakite values of course still agree.  This simply makes sense.

Idea #0635:
	All sky boys and also zarakite values see going out to bother and bully someone they never met and never even started to get to know or even talk to as invariably evil and hostile and mean and what should be hated and what should be seen as hostile.  This type of thing is also what makes an aggressor an evil a--hole and bully and hostile that is victimizing someone innocent that never bothered or did anything to the aforementioned bully to begin with.  Proto was hardly ever a bully life-long to an extent that no human being has ever achieved or sustained in the entire history of the human species and therefore has massive innocence that no human being who ever lived comes close to having.  Proto tried otherwise just a handful of times perhaps and it never felt natural or normal or anything he felt he would like or want to do or have fun doing.  Paul S Reeves was freuently a bully and an a--hole over the years and wanted to be evil like that and sure enjoyed himself being a bully of that type in a lot more than junior high school and high school.  Sally Lynn Reeves was also a bully in similar if not the same type of anything-but-innocent evil ways and has been evil like that before I was born in 1978 and never grew up or grew out of it lifelong by mundane standards.  Paul S Reeves never grew out of being a bully either.  All of this simply makes sense.

Idea #0636:
	I never associated blond-haired Brian with Marty McFly regardless of the coats they wore.  This is in regards to the blue-colored down coat that blond-haired Brian wore when he was at Tri-C in the same Web Design programming class taught by an associate of Matt Weisfeld and the red sleeveless coat M J Fox wore for his 'Back to the Future' role as 'Marty McFly' which had a red color, and the two people never reminded me of each other and were never associated with each other in any of my MD or imaginary fantasies or any daydreaming visions I ever created.

	dork personalities have NO say in any of this Idea of course

Idea #0711:
	Today Tuesday November 3 2019, I went downstairs to during store hours to get two cans of diet mountain dew which from the 'store' that activities runs at this nursing home, which I had been promised by the executive director in charge of the entire nursing home as well as the boss who runs activities that the soda pop would be paid for and I wouldn't have to worry about getting two cans of whatever pop I wanted every day for a week starting November 1st after there have been recent corruption and criminal issues among the staff and people involved with this nursing home [mind controllers and thought controllers and thought control technology as well as hypnosis and related thought control tools and spy technologies in the hands of dark hearted have been involved as well as corrupt officials that have had issues dealing with such].  Yesterday things went smoothly and I got two cans of soda pop and I gave them my name and room number so that they knew who I was for mundane and non-telepathic reasons and pretense, and things went smoothly.  I have also been writing these things down and documenting them, as I was told to do by officials and such.  These aforementioned officials have told me themselves that they are aware that I am not a human being and for those who handle that information such isn't consistent because not everyone has the same security clearance and credentials and etc, but irregardless they all know that I am not from outer space and am from planet Earth and irregardless I am and always have been a civilian.  Those that I'm guessing have higher clearance or security clearance or rank or whatever know that I am a 'juvenile' or 'underage' for my kind and I am a shape-shifter by nature and am involuntarily stuck in a bad 'form factor' or body and involvuntarily look like an old man and archaic human and right now there's notthing I can do about it.  Some officials involved depending on their clearace and what offices they work at have already said in the past that they don't always believe all of it but accept it as if they believe it in a professional sense where they take orders from their boss and if their boss tells them they have to accept it in a professional sense and leave their personal beliefs and feelings out of it then they do that.  [This isn't rocket science, as CIA and NSA and FBI and non-USA agencies and civlian groups I think as well [I think but I would have to check] have been involved for a long time and I know for a fact that common non-telepathic ordinary and boring city police officers can be professional like how I'm describing and if their boss says they have to professionally accept information as being true even if they don't personally believe it than they do exactly that and behave as if they believe it while in uniform and will pretty much say 'yes sir' to their boss and follow orders.  This type of 'professional' by the way is non-dark trio and not something the dark trio have in their values, and also is well supported by zarakite values.]  The telepatic operators and officials have told me today stuff that they say I can't really get into about their corruption sweeps and how they are having problems with their own staff in their offices and arresting some people and some of their own are getting reassigned while others are getting fired and some are actually getting the electric chair over these issues and others are 'wanted' and are being treated by USA military and law enforcement as 'enemy combatants' and are being hunted like terrorists while some irregardless have military-grade security cameras taking non-stop recordings and providing overseers with footage to watch some of the telepathic operators for corruption issues and to lead to these arrests and they are actually working with really big results and stuff and I'm guessing they'll be getting more [these ideas as well as a lot of the terminology they've been using I've never heard of before including from Tri-C and my job on campus and are their ideas and not things I've ever heard of before and they sound to me like they work fine with zarakite values and they are working.].  I actually don't know if me getting certain amounts of cans of pop and documenting it all for an enitre week is actually a test or not and for their evidence and corruption stuff, but then again to be fair I didn't ask and it's not like I work in their offices and are their supervisors or anything of course.  Anyways, today I ended up getting only one can of diet mountain dew.  I went downstairs at about 2:00 PM or 14:00, and on the weekends both Saturday and Sunday they run their store for half an hour from 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM, while during the week they run it from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM.  Today I forgot to tell them expicitly [sp?] my name and room number, and I asked for it from a lady who is a resident here at this nursing home who doesn't work here but helps out at the store often.  She usually remembers who I am and has helped out downstairs with their store all the time for months and I think ever since I moved into this place but she isn't there every day.  When I asked her for two cans of diet mountain dew she told me on the spot that she would only get me one can and claimed that it was because they supposedly were running low on soda pop and would only give out one can instead of their usual two-can-per-day limit today.  I asked her what other types of soda pop they had for a second can, and she acted oddly and was ad-libbing again and seemed to still be making up information on the fly about the nursing home being 'low on pop' and so she would only give one can to me no matter what and she refused to tell me what other types of soda pop they had [they normally have many types of soda pop in their store for residents, all the time and every day of the year].  The nursing staff [the ones who actually work here and don't live here of course] actually started getting on her case about how she was acting oddly and making up information on the spot like that, and several of them were in that office and at least two of them were on her case right away and were confronting her on her behavior right in front of me and were being logical and practical and reasonable and asking the lady who lives here why she was making up stuff and only serving me one soda pop and being deceptive and childish in refusing to tell me what other drinks they have in stock.  I didn't want to push it, or rock the boat as the saying goes, so I simply accepted the one single mountain dew in the can it came in and left and went back upstairs without knowing what other soda pop they have in the store in stock as well as any other answers.  I told them to take it 'off the books' when asked which I believe is what I was supposed to do according to what I think the executive director as well as later the woman in charge of activities wanted me to do.  I did however goof in that I forgot to say what my name is and what room number I live in, which I don't think was their fault.  Also, the staff who don't live here and actually work here are mostly knew in activities, and haven't been here for long weeks and months unlike the lady who lives here and simply helps out at the store.  I've also been trying to follow instructions and do what I was told to do and document and sometimes handwrite but also type out when practical [I guess] and document what happens with the people here and me getting service and how much and if I am bullied or not.  I also noticed that allies and failsafes and officials who are good and have not been compromised and also are compliant with zarakite values have fought hard for me to get caffeine in more than one form including both coffee and soda pop of more than one type and also for me to have my video games and movies and enjoy them including the movies and music videos I download from Youtube and the Pirate's Bay and Bit Torrent and stuff that is illegal for humans to do and I'm supposed to get these things I've been told by their offices and stuff [including the FBI I was told to mention again].  They've also fought long and hard for me to not be expected to swallow medication and flush pills down the toilet right after they leave the room and I'm not expected to be extremely discreet as I'm not a policeman or anything and I wouldn't know how to do that anything close to how an undercover cop would do that and be convincing, and because expecting me to be able to do anything close to that is unfair and unreasonable they give me a break and look the other way and let me flush the toilet with those pills right after they leave the room and can I'm sure hear the toilet flushing every time.  I noticed by the way that today the staff on the second floor are having their own personal staff-only pizza party with a huge pile of pizzas in boxes from a local store that were literally more than a couple dozen full-size pizza boxes and were taken up on a big luggage cart and to an employee break room on the second floor and they also were taking up a lot of soda pop from local fast food or pizza stores and such, and they fought for that for themselves in return for fighting for me to have just two cans of soda pop a day for a week without having to worry about it being paid for because of their problems and issues that involve criminal behavior as well as hostile mind controllers and thought control problems with at least one of their receptionists.  They have a lot of fun with this type of thing, where if they allow me to have two cans of pop a day for a week like this as a special measure because of the issues we are having that both they and I know I can't do anything about and don't have any ability to stop, and 'in return' for fighting for me to have two cans a day for a week like that with special safeguards they spend what I'm guessing is literally hundreds of dollars on a massive pizza party and who knows what else they are spending how much money on that probably isn't theirs to spend.  This deliberate unfair and uneven 'if you get something than I get something but I get a mountain of it while you get a tiny bit and I call it even in my book' is already long-established and long-reported as being dark trio and evil according to zarakite values as well as criminal and already what has gotten some human officials death penalties and executions well over a month ago and well over a year ago and actually well over a couple of decades ago as the dark trio have always been like this and this was already reported and logged and documented and established by myself and telepatic operators when I lived in North Olmsted and also when I ended up in Cleveland Clinic in the Lutheran branch and all inclusive through when I had already been living here at Wyant Woods in Fairlawn Ohio.  I had also been handwriting and typing and explaining these things to daytime and nighttime teams repeatedly and they had their own feedback and back and forth discussions that included me where they were talking intelligently and obviously already accepted this type of information and understood it already, both day and night and many days of the week.  In the past in so many discussions this has been referred to as 'tit for tat' and 'if you give an inch you act evil and take a whole damn new jersey turnpike' with references to a Sylvester Stallone comdey movie and also an old comedy movie called 'Spaceballs' where the main character Darth Helmet which is a rip off of Darth Vader [the film is a spoof of Star Wars, Mel Brooks etc] is evil and admits that he can't ever tolerate a fair fight and he insists on always having an unfair fight where he has an unfair advantage and everyone else has no fair chance to even come close to competing and has unfair restrictions and circumstances that are very deliberate and very evil.  Conversations with an old independent clinical psychologist named Doctor Chapman who was a secret agent undercover as a psychologist in therapy and couseling sessions also had this type of deliberate unfair and rule-breaking and knowingly and deliberate unethical 'tit for tat' as it was called that was actually anything but even, came up plenty of times, when I was not allowed or able to bargain fairly for anything and neither was he.  He was frequently mind controlled and thought controlled back and forth in more than one direction by more than one interest and more than one set of values, and such included the dark trio including of course the original Sally Lynn Reeves.  This type of deliberately unfair and unequal bargaining is still dark trio and still has the same judgement according to zarakite values regarding good versus evil and still simply makes sense.  It was already documented and established and hasn't changed, except of course by dark trio and dark hearted and criminal and evil beings and species involved that include humans as well as beings dragged into this from other planets and other solar systems that were lied to and decieved including tricked into being dishonest and deceptive by certain humans and they would not have lied for aforementioned humans had they known and not been mind controlled and thought controlled and hypnotized and manipulated by aforementioned humans and their evil and criminal actions that were and still are illegal according to long-established laws and paperwork that exists outside of telepathy and has proper and official and professional legal words and terminology that criminal courts and judges and prosecutors in USA courts use and accept and understand in public cases that don't involve any telepathy or weird stuff.  This includes the CIA as well as the FBI and NSA and Secret Service as well as KGB and Japanese authorities and French and plenty of other government agencies including space agencies and law enforcement and military and exosolars who already had this sort of paperwork and information in their records and files to begin with and still do.  Politicians and presidents and senators and parliments and prime ministers and emporers and monarchs worldwide the same, including the USA.  This is still what I think is the case and isn't untrue, although needless to say I never worked at those agencies for any human nation's government and I've never been a government official with that type of authority and credentials, so of course I don't know for a fact how accurate all of this is and still simply makes sense.

Idea #0712:
	Today Monday November 9th 2019 Common Era, about 9:30 AM, some lady who did not identify herself and presumably works at this nursing home walked in to my bedroom without being invited and without asking for permission to enter, and opened one closet door [the one that does not have a lock on it] and without asking first.  She also said outloud 'I'm checking your closet.' without saying anything else and without saying why and without identifying herself.  She did not explain any rationale or pretense for what she was doing or why she was acting this way.  The way she acted as described so far, is itself very unusual and odd and weird for anyone at this nursing home, applicable to both residents as well as workers of all kinds here [which include supervisors, nurses, doctors, janitors, cooks, secretaries, clerical workers, everyone, of course].  No residents, not even the most senile ones, act this way either.  She was not wearing any sort of uniform, not for a doctor or a nurse or a janitor, none whatsoever.  She did not have any stethoscope [sp?] and did not have any hangtag or lanyard or ID hanging from her clothing.  She said nothing more than 'I'm checking your closet.'  She also summoned one of the regualar nursing aids, the same who brought in my breakfast tray earlier this morning, and pointed and gestured to contents of what was in my closet and was talking to her [the aforefemtioned nursing staff] as if she [the woman who entered and refused to identify herself and did not have permission or authorization to enter where I live, and also did not have permission or authorization to open any closet of mine or access any of my belongings for any reason as well as no pretense for doing such things] works here at this nursing home and is supposedly some sort of co-worker or whatever of hers even though she was clearly not a nurse and did not behave like anyone who works or belongs here.  This unidentified woman, who by the way I've never seen or heard of before, her behavior has been determined to be that of a hostile and a mind controller and also as part of a 'fuck' which has also been called 'screw-over' and 'screw-up' in the past, and is characteristic of hostile mind controllers invading planet Earth who are a severe threat and danger to all human beings left and right wherever they go.  In this specific case, this unidentified woman is a hostile enemy combatant that is not with planet Earth or anyone of planet Earth or zarakite values, at all whatsoever, and she is also a threat to everyone in this nursing home on both floors, a threat to all human beings who do not have sufficient protection.  'Sufficient Protection' is not a legal term as I see it, as it is something enforced by real life and the laws of physics and science, such as gravity.  Just like gravity, whether or not such protection is sufficient as well as effective etc isn't anything a lawyer in any court can argue and refute and stall for any reason and then find that he can fly around like Superman [Look, lawyers who are archaics and from the USA are slimy and kniving and have reputations for being such, and are quite used to it, and even know how to use it for good as well as evil and can actually be kinda cool when they do stuff for you and do wierd stuff that 'mandate' that some bothersome neighbor has to walk on all fours and bark like a dog whenever he goes outside or get arrested or something, but anyways they can't argue or 'object' to the laws of gravity and physics and make inanimate objects levitate and such and cast magic spells with legal motions.  On planet Earth, those are 'magicians' as well as 'witches' and 'warlocks' and 'shamans' and people with plenty of other names and titles etc who do those things, and sometimes those titles are professional titles while at other times they are different types of names.  Lawyers and attorneys that are archaics, from the USA, as if there's any difference, arn't magicians or spellcasters or whatever the PC and legal catch-all term a lawyer would use in court would use.]  [Something tells me that someone needs this, again:  The term 'archaic' is a proper and technical term in American Zarakite English that refers to a 'human being' of the 'homo sapiens sapiens' species, and is also called 'archaic human being' and also 'historical species'.  These terms are not derogatory or slang terms, or offensive.  'Ancients' are also called 'humans' and 'human beings' and so the terms 'archaic' and 'archaic human' are used to differentiate.  Look, I'm not an English major and don't always spell these things the right way, but 'archaic' is what a human who looks at himself in the mirror sees if you're talking about a human that is alive today in 2019 at the start of November, and they can get old and frail and diabetic and don't survive getting decapitated and I wouldn't let them in a swordfight.  Also, if they get shot or get a finger or arm ripped off they are SLOW and double over and cry and whine and scream and have to, given that they are in PAIN like what non-sentients like wolves and deer feel when injured, and they hurt and suffer, and can't take stuff like that that's just unfair and brutal and cruel for them and what's left of their species.  I don't blame them for screaming in pain when that happens, as well as not really being in the mood to be useful or earn any paycheck and 'get back to work', yikes.  And no, this doesn't mean you get a new job.  What you do is you don't work there in the first place and you rip apart the asshole psychopathic heartless employer limb from limb, and feel the satisfying crunching sounds of their bones crushing and breaking as the son of a bitch gets what they deserve, good riddance, and innocents feel a lot better, and a bunch of other stuff I'd call well justified that salt said I'm not to explain and I didn't even ask Mister Standish yet.]   Anyways, speaking of the intruder who no one has said works here or lives here or belongs here, she's been identified as a hostile mind controller, and possibly someone undercover, although many hostile mind controllers often present themselves as 'undercover' agents and special agents and intel agency and spy agency 'operatives' and spies and stuff and then claim that they were working undercover so that they can't be vilified or arrested or go to jail when they do things on planet Earth that start with walking into places they don't belong and being able to act as if they own the place and also have 'instantaneous credibility' wherever they go where no one accuses them of being an intruder and everyone thinks that they belong there and have a right to be there no matter what profession or uniform.  Hostile mind controllers already developed 'psychic pretense' to do these things on planet Earth decades ago if not for far longer, and have done these things consistently for so long and made it a 'regular thing' and a 'usual everyday' type of thing.  They have the same pretense and 'regular thing' established with the entire archaic species who they've adapted to being used to it, for being hostile mind controllers that victimize people both as their undercover roles as well as their undercover identities as well.]  Speaking of 'sufficient protection', this means either being possessed by friendly/allied psychics and beings who are extraterrestrials from whatever realm [time and space, universe, dimension, alternate reality, set of galactic filaments, etc], or being thought controlled by a friendly/allied skynet, or some combination of the two which in any combination irregardless is complaint with zarakite values, and no matter how you slice it these arn't legal terms but are like the laws of physics like how gravity and laws of physics work.  Look, I'm a kid and I don't know the PC or 'textbook' stuff to describe these things like what you would find in any dictionary, but I'm told by experts and those who know what they're talking about, 'grown-ups' salt just told me to say, that 'sufficient protection' and some of these other terms are not legal terms.  I was also told in the past that sometimes I have to re-word ['rephrase' I was told to mention] what I type and handwrite, in ways that make it sound funny sometimes, and count commas and punctuation marks.  Anyways, I remember I was told to mention that no one who lives or works at this nursing home ever made it any sort of regular thing or 'pretense' I was told to call it without saying 'psychic pretense' for this sentence, to enter without authorization and open the closet and not ever explain why or establish any such thing ahead of time or get permission ahead of time to start doing such a thing, and she did not do any of that and I had never seen her before, and she admitted with further mundane out-loud conversation back-and-forth with myself with 'active listening' that she was trying to start something brand new that none of the people at this nursing home ever did before and also that I have been living here for more than a year now already and she was trying to start something 'brand new'.  This SIMPLY MAKES SENSE.

Idea #0713:
	Friday November 1st 2019, 2019-11-01 EST, I handwrote the following on a single peice of paper on two sides, one side before getting a sanck from the store activities runs, and the other side afterwards.  I am typing what I handwrote, and copying such word-for-word:
	Friday November 1st 2019 1:05 PM or 13:05 I Just spoke to the executive director, personally and face-to-face, in charge of this entire nursing home, in his office downstairs, and told him about Joann the receptionist and two other Negro women who also work here [one of them an STNA who impersonated a unit manager and pretended several times to be a supervisor above the receptionist], and how Joann lied to me about money supposedly not being in my resident account, then admitted she lied and and there actually is legit and real money still in my resident account, and Joann the receptionist has done this type of thing and unprofessional corruption several times now at least and already, and the other two Negro women who were downstairs and include the STNA were also acting corrupt and unprofessional in similiar ways, and the receptionist Joann decided to take a 90-minute/hour-and-a-half break suddenly just because I wanted my own money from my resident account available at the 'store' for activities so I can have food and drinks and snacks etc, and the executive director in charge of the whole nursing home who has the phrase 'executive director' literally on his office door all in caps personally took my name and room number, David Reeves room 230, after a brief verbal conversation, and he promised me professionally that today, the same day, activities staff and their store downstairs where they sell drinks and snacks will have money available and I will be able and allowed to get two soft drinks of my choice today from such, and he remembers and has all this information in his computer in his office, and he is in charge of this nursing home and everyone in it including all doctors and all nurses and all supervisors, of course.
	On the other side, I wrote:
	Friday November 1st 2019 I got the two cans of diet mountain dew I wanted from downstairs, during their store hours, I asked for them and got them, it wasn't too bad, the Negro lady in charge of activities told me not to worry about the most recent 36 pack or how much money I do or don't have left on the books, others down there with activities and also the resident who bellows during bingo were part of the conversation as well and I'm sure will remember, and the lady in charge of activities was being nice and told me not to worry about paying for two cans of whatever soda I wanted plus snacks for a whole week while things settle down and get better around here, and I was told to write all of this down, and I also noticed things improve when I drink caffeine from more than one source including coffee and soda pop in the same day and not just one of the two, and adding extra salt also always helps when I add it to almost or always everything I eat and drink [always is what I think applies here], and eating and drinking while at least standing up and sometimes walking and sometimes standing in place also helps, at least sometimes, and getting extra drinks including milk and tea and juice of various sorts that I normally and naturally like the taste of also seem to help, and stevia also seems to make a positive difference, as well as certain types of foods that include at least ketchup and grapes and eggs and skim milk and also chocolate, and having ice also is good but plain water doesn't, and cinnamon does good, and salt packets versus salt from a can versus the brand of salt packets makes no real difference to me at least, and ranch dressing is good, and mayo is good, and me having video games as well as gaming computers and music and movies doesn't seem evil, and me using them and having them work well isn't evil in my experience.  In my experience, me personally having money and luxeries and junk food isn't evil in any direct way and doesn't make bad things happen, at all.

Idea #0714:
	I try to make it a habit to wear a shirt, one way or another, when I leave my bedroom, for now at least, which simply makes sense.

Idea #0715:
	I try to make it normal for me to often but not always have three pieces of metal silverware in my bedroom at a time, one knife and one fork and one spoon, but not any more than such, and return silver in excess of such back to the staff who work here, more or less.  I leave such aforementioned silverware in plain sight where any of the staff can easily take and reclaim any or all of such, no questions asked.  So far, the entire time I have lived here and as a 'normal' thing that has well-established pretense for over a year now, none of the nursing staff have complained or spoken to me about this practice or told me it is wrong or any sort of problem or issue of any kind at all whatsoever.  For more than a year invariably and unbreakable and all inclusive in real they have not done anything or said anything to hint or tell me in any way that I'm doing anything wrong with this type of habit and unspoken mutual understanding that we all have and they would make conversation of this habit of mine that I started and have been open and honest and not the slightest bit sneaky about and yet the entire time they have not had any problem with this habit or made it discussion or started pretense of any sort to, and this simply makes sense.  They know that I would of course do the proper and honorable thing and not hang on to such silverware and give it back to them if they were to start a mundane and polite verbal and face-to-face conversation of the sort any human being of the previous century would normally be familiar with, and this simply makes sense.  They know this and so do I, and we know that each of us knows this, and is okay with it, firmly and mutually long established as habit and normalcy and pretense and a perk, and this simply makes sense.  They also know I'm not hiding anything, and we mutually understand such, and this also simply makes sense.

Idea #0716:
	The nursing staff are aware of my mutated and broken body/form-factor that never shape-shifted and isn't human, even though it looks just like that of a human being [archaic], and want my feet and toes exposed and visible when I'm not going outside, and not wear any socks unlike a typical archaic human being nursing home resident, for now.  They get uptight and mean and become evil and their personalities warp and shift into heartless evil former-human being personalities that are just plain evil, and both them and I mutually suffer and get punished by rules I have never heard of and never established or wanted, if I wear socks in the hallways and elevator and downstairs.  For whatever reason they need to be able to see and look at my bare feet and toes as much as practical, at least in their peripheral vision even if they arn't paying attention to such.  I didn't write these psychic/telepathic/spiritual rules that are not from my religion but someone else's, and I'm not convinced they did either but I don't actually know.  Personally I blame the dark hearted and dark trio, the original such that are not of this Earth and never were, including the old queen who isn't from this universe [whole galaxies and clusters and galactic filaments, and the wikipedia has articles on what a 'galactic filament' is and how gigantic it is and also the size of the 'known universe' and how far the big bang has reached etc].  As a side note, my religion does not have any 'creation myth' as far as I know, much like wicca and Seax-wica and certain types of Earth-based pagan witchcraft religions that I have had personal first-hand experience and connections with over the years.  Instead of any 'creationism' I've always believed in what astronomers from space agencies [ie NASA, etc] believe in such as the Big Bang etc and how the early planet Earth before human beings and dinosaurs existed had carbon dioxide and no oxygen and then early single-cell plant life which actually came from undersea volcanoes as the first crude and primitive cells [self-replicating primitive bags of amino acids and early organic chemicals and stuff although I'd have to re-read old books and watch Carl Sagan again as it's been a while], and then oxygen was an organic pollutant that such early life generated which then led to natural consequences of early animal life forms that came about that would breathe the oxygen and eat the plant life etc.  [I've always been into this type of science and history over the years and not just in school, including from VHS and Carl Sagan and old science books written and published for kids back when video rental stores had both VHS and Betamax sections and VCRs would cost upwards of $300 to $400 and not everyone had them and video games included Atari and Pole Position and Laser Tag from 'Worlds of Wonder' and had a TV show for a while along with the Smurfs and He-man and the Care-Bears and Sesame Street which didn't have lesbian or politically correct characters and the shows weren't so sensitive and messed up and riding in a car past a gas station meant seing a sign for unleaded that had a big ZERO and THEN had a decimal point and THEN had a couple of numbers and that was the 'normal thing' the whole year and not just any season of such.  Oh that and smart phones and cell phones and email didn't exist as anyone knew it more or less, and some phones had a rotary dial thing that would spin and click and you had to call a friend ahead of time from a LAND LINE as 'no one' had any 'portable phone' which would cost an arm and a leg and have a blasted backpack with and actual hook and reciever and big-ass fold-up anttena and look like something a Vietnam soldier would carry into the jungle for radio transmissions with.  No, you had to call friends at home while both you and they were both home or leave a message, and see who shows up later or the next day and not know who would be there until that time came.  I used to tell people face to face in the apartment building I lived in and the college I went to about these things, and then ramble on and talk about going to the video store while riding in the family's 'Toyotasaurus' and other dumb nonsense and then see how some people would still continue to pay attention and nod their heads and not always understand I'm joking.  Most figured out I went off-topic and 'into the bullshit zone' but I seriously wonder who missed it at first, geez.....  Now that I know what I didn't know before, I'm now thinking about the Speech professor Ms whats-her-face who I actually told 'You know your head is on fire and you might want to stick it in a nearby toliet soon' after telling her a few things about school assignments and I was testing her to see if she was paying attention and lo-and-behold she nodded and smiled slightly and had no other emotional reaction exactly just the same and I simply kept a straight face while laughing inside.  It remind me of 'Sir, you are pointing to the wrong pillar' spoken calmy and matter-of-factly and with a straight face to a cop who was yelling and angry and spazzing out.  Hey, he was just being honest - it's not like he was lying or doing anything wrong, and I'm sure the guy wanted him to be honest with him, right?]  Anyways, I continue to walk around outside my bedroom without any shoes or socks when I do, as I don't want to 'rock the boat' with any 'porridge boy' with any 'telepathic psychic CIA' that is holding 'invisible' guns to my head as well as those of the nursing staff and residents at times and is actually a mutual enemy of myself AND all of the human species and is very deceptive and kniving and combative and tricky and manipulative and dark hearted and dark trio [the original, old dark trio.  That and 'original' here is lower-case and has nothing to do with any Book Of Faces, which still simply makes sense.] and I've been told isn't really part of any real CIA and is an enemy of the real actual USA CIA that doesn't have or use telepathy and is a creation of the dark trio and pet project of the original psychic Paul S Reeves who I still call the Dark Prince and has many enemies from various planets and more than one galaxy and is wanted and very dangerous and would never accept zarakite values and refuses to be sexual and insists on being like a monk and meditating and is very psychic with true actual stuff that isn't from planet Earth and has been involved with exosolars and telapathic networks longer than I have been alive for.]  I have had to put up with 'porridge boy' and his deceptions and yield to him and his/her/it's/whatever non-human personality insanity just like everyone else.  As far as I know this is the most accurate information I have so far although I still don't even know a tenth of it, and the elves who are not from planet Earth to begin with have guided me at times as to what is and was real to begin with before the dark trio began messing up time and space and reality and generating a paradox here and there in various ways and no one can safely time-travel back before certain times near the end of the twentieth century according to at least one source of information because of their evils.  Time splicing by the way is way over my head and not ever anything I had in grade school or anything, that and string theory which I don't understand and was told is related.  Anyways, if I don't rock the boat and push for too much, like starting to wear socks outside the bedroom and other stuff that tends to piss off porridge boy, it seems to create less headaches and less weird influence and less evil for myself and the human beings in this nursing home that live and work here, and I think this makes sense.  Fortunately, my allies who are with zarakite values and support me and zarakites how I want including the zarakite sex drive and are from more than one planet seem to be winning at defeating 'porridge boy' and what they created and have left behind in places although the war isn't over yet.  This isn't all of what I think I know, and I still need salt and ingredients and caffeine and video games and pleasure without being bullied to get proper guidance and help in various ways for myself as well as any hope that any human beings anywhere and in any life and any afterlife might have not to mention other civilizations of various other worlds and galaxies as well.  I think this simply makes sense.  One source who calls himself an elf says I'm wrong on at least one of these concepts.  The elves know what it means when I say this and use these words, I think this simply makes sense.

Idea #0717:
	I have not been diabetic at any time over the last year and then some, by my species standards.  I have not felt dizzy or faint for any reasons related to diabeties or blood sugar in at least the last year.  I have not at all whatsoever been hospitalized or couseled or diagnosed by any endrocrinologist with anything related to diabetes or hypoglycemia or blood sugar, in at least all of this year and last year.  I know all of this is correct and so does Sally Lynn Reeves in mundane ways and in other ways and always will.  I know all of this altogether more or less simply makes sense.

Idea #0718:
	Among other things, salt always knows and enforces what I would want if I knew more and were to hypothetically think about anything, as well as what I would want with what I know if I were to think about hypothetically anything, with what I know having priority over what I want if I knew more and were to hypothetically think about anything, all at any given time.  Eating salt and various food ingredients that I like and enjoy in various combinations, as well as playing video games I like and ejaculating and enjoying music I like, and having these things do what I want of salt as described in this Idea, are altogether one of my chief wants and desires.  All of these various hypothetical things I could want and desire in various ways I want to be logical and practical and realistic and intelligent and also lacking any paradox.  I think this was and still is and will continue to simply make sense.

Idea #0719:
	2019-11-06 CE 06:19 EST Salt told me, for now, that if all dragon boys can fly at the same maximum speed at age 5, that at age five they can fly up to about mach two in the skies of planet Earth, which is about 1534 mph or ?2468 kph.  Earth said that mach three was also a possiblitiy but would be asking for a lot.  Given that planet Earth is roughly 25,000 miles around or 40,000 kilometers around in circumferance, a zarakite flying at roughly mach two could fly all the way around the planet and end up back where he started in roughly 16.3 hours.  This also means that such a zarakite could fly to a party on the other side of the planet in about eight-and-a-half hours one-way, spend about seven hours having fun there, and then spend another eight-and-a-half hours with the return trip.  This would take an entire day, 24 hours, and zarakites don't sleep with any sort of regular day-night cycle.  This assumes that a zarakite can fly at full speed for that long if he shape-shifts to be age five regardless of how tall he stands and the top speed is about mach two.

Idea #0720:
	Sky boys do not poop, and also can't pull down their legwear.  Their legwear is part of their anatomy and skin and flesh that grows out of their hips, and when seperating at the waist to leave behind their legs as detachables, the legwear stays with the legs and not the chest-and-torso/upper-half.  The same goes for ancients and hybrids.  Regarding the total potential detachables a sky boy can have, such includes - the head [at the top of the neck, so when detaching there is no neck that is attached to the head], the chest and torso which sometimes includes the neck and goes down to the waist just below the waistband of the legwear [the waistband of the legwear is attached at the bottom of the waistband and detached legs that are standing have the waistband poke up all around in full circumferance just above the top of the body and skin which is concave and has no openings or features other than skin/body-skin, by about a few centimeters or so but varies when the legwear is longwinds.  Also, the waistband grows out of the pelvis and hips at the sides and in the center of the back and is not airtight and allows air and rain and liquids to flow into and down the legs above the butt cheeks and also above the penis and groin area and down the legs etc.], the right-hand arm which includes the upper arm and lower-arm/forearm and wrist but not the hand/glove and the top of such goes all the way up to the top of the shoulder and when detached leaves no stump and no anatomy sloping outward from the torso/chest-and-shoulder-blades-area at all, individual hands and gloves ['gloves' refers to hands with fingerless gloves that are natural sky boy clothing and can be cosmetic but can also grow technology and swords and guns and tools and have icons on the parts of the fingerless gloves that are the back of the hand], the pelvis and hips which have the legwear attached [there is always some legwear, and such is never naked, as legwear shape-shifts from one type directly to another without degenerating in-between at all], individual legs from the pelvis and hips which when detached come loose and slide out of the 'legs' of the legwear [such as 'pants' or trousers, or longwinds, etc], shirts and jackets that can be detached and removed [?], legwear [?], hats which are a baseball cap that is grown out of parts of the skin of the head and is loose [not anchored, so it can be knocked loose or pulled off easily like an archaic human's traditional baseball-style hat of some sort] [?], individual eyeballs - [?].  This is true for all sky boys, although for ancients and hybrids this is still cloudy.

Idea #0721:
	Tethering is involved with a sky boy's digestive system so that he has a working esophagus [sp?] and windpipe even when his head is detached, as well as his bowels/intestinal-track as well as how he has functional anatomy even though he lacks a rectum and has no butthole [in-between his butt-cheeks, if he were to pull them apart sideways, is no hole, for anything at all.  If he then lets go and just stands or lies down in a neutral pose and he pulls up his legwear, his butt-cheeks and crack in between look just like an archaic human being and this is normal.]  Note that large butt cheeks, even if from being muscular, are unattractive to the zarakite sex drive.  This is true even with a thin and slender body that has no body fat to the point of having visible abdominal muscles that are an 'eight pack'.

Idea #0722:
	My skills at modeling [making 3D characters in Blender and other similar software] SUCK, and after long years of struggling to make a zarakite of even one face I've yet to finish my first model.  The hands and fingers aren't the right proportion or shape and should be like that of a human of applicable age and body fat and health and athletic nature.  The rib cage and chest bones and pectorals as well as legs and also knees and feet are not the right proportions, not to mention shoulder blades and nipples and arms and elbows.  The neck is too thick for my liking in a few places, both side-to-side as well as front-to-back.  The head and face with the mouth a little open is probably the best and most well done, and looks about right for a TigerStone face of age five.  The eyeballs and especially eyelids and eyelashes still need work and shouldn't look like a plastic or porcelin doll of any kind.  The mohawk haircut shouldn't be like any 'liberty spikes' style but should instead be more like a bottlebrush or when a feline is startled and his fur stands up on end not only across the back but also along the tail going outward in all directions along the tail, when the animal is in flight-or-fight and is standing sideways and very tense and agitated and trying to make himself look larger and intimidating to any predator or opponent with his fur standing up like that and his spine a bit arched.  [Felis domesticus or what archaics call 'housecats' do this when startled or scared, and their 'pet owners' that 'domesticate' them and arn't born yesterday are quite familiar with this.]  Various facial expressions in the Blender files are a disaster and look silly and cartoon-show-like and the teeth including the fangs and also the tounge could all be done better, as well as the inside of the mouth.  Part of the problem with the face and lips and teeth etc as well as the eyelids and eye sockets are Z-fighting/depth-buffer issues, which has to do with OpenGL and computer graphics technical stuff that people who don't program computer video or do 3D graphics with such technology probably wouldn't be familiar with not to mention camera matricies and verticies and world and view and model persective and camera matricies and three-dimensional video graphics technology stuff that OpenGL and DirectX and Direct3D and video games use.  In other words, to make a long story short, the head and face look great with the mouth hanging open and will work good for a TigerStone face that is age five and four and is astonished and also decapitated and relaxed and also ejaculating and the rest is an up-and-down disaster left and right and would take another decade or so for me to continue to never get finished.  Salt and other pleasures [not just foods] can in some combination explain more, which of course simply makes sense.  So can others.

Idea #0723:
	'Domesticate' is a somewhat ugly term in American Sky Boy English, and refers to a practice that zarakite values usually see as evil, although when it comes to creatures outside of planet Earth in origin zarakites are generally polite and diplomatic and don't like to get nosy into the cultures and rules of another civilization and instead prefer to keep their opinions to themselves [?].  'Domesticate' and 'domesticated' are also words that come up in smartass jokes and wisecracks and sarcasm and sayings, with sex and flirting and dating and also when sky boys and ancients and hybrids get 'rabid' or 'hyperactive' and need to settle down, and other non-lilteral casual conversation etc.  This type of thing varies among clans of sky boys, as kahjeet don't talk the same way or use the same sayings as dragon sky boys, as one example [?].

Idea #0724:
	I've noticed that as I've reached out to and tried to contact my chosen, some of them have been surprised at how real these things are regarding a mind controller invasion and 'skynet' stuff as well as why we 'have to' unfortunately do this on planet Earth and I really do sympathize and care and have been told that there arn't alternatives with what has transpired and 'wishful thinking' etc won't even come close to any real solutions and neither will any 'Oh, well just "splice" it with time and space and reality.....' unrealistic attitude that many have become disillusioned from.  Wishing for instant gratification and some almighty wave-of-a-magic-wand deus ex machina doesn't work in real life of course, just like a man living in a cardboard box can't crawl into his bed of dirty towels and newspapers in some ally and 'just wish to be a millionare with a limo and mansion' when he wakes up and expect it to actually happen.  [I can imagine if it did seem to happen, he should be on his guard and be suspicious of a looks-too-good-to-be-true type of con or scam, and should be like 'okay, what's the gag here?' and be ready to fight or flee and maybe lose the few personal possessions he has left.  That type of suspicious attitude is understandable and logical and probably what a man like that develops and has, and uses to survive, with the type of lifestyle he has and is stuck with.]  Anyways, I care and I've tried to come up with options and choices for my chosen, and have been told over and over I can't, and that for many of them I'm not allowed because they've screwed up and did things they shouldn't have and don't deserve it, and I'm a kid and just have to put up with that.  I'm surprised, as most of them are grown-up and some have their own children and stuff, and for most of them they're only human, but, still.....  Some of them are better than others, I've been told.  I think they have been pulled into things that are unfair for them, but it's not just my opinion and I can't do everything and I HATE talking like this, ugh.....  On the other hand none of them have sued me or threatened to sue me, and at times many of them have seemed to understand me enough to see that I mean well and I care but I've been up against a wall myself at times.  I also haven't gotten any messages from them saying that I have to take down stuff I had to post on the Internet either.  I've been surprised as quite a bit of the stuff I've had to post is a bit, uh, PERSONAL yikes.....  This is really messed up any way you slice it and this simply makes sense.

Idea #0725:
	Note to self:  Write or type or otherwise document my experiences getting soda pop and other stuff from the staff here, including the last two days when I ended up with one diet mountain dew and one coke one day, and two pepsis another day, and anything with any of the other staff including the receptionist I guess.  Verbose or at least a few details are probably best, and this is for the solar wyveryns [sp?] that I promised I would do this for [they are among my staunch and long-time allies, and I owe them].  This is for a number of them and not just Jonathan Brandis.

Idea #0726:
	I was told by one source that when my TK is only one percent unlocked, that this is enough that if I am sparring in a martial arts dojo and both I and my sparring partner are both wearing pads and protective gear including headgear, that the punching gloves and pads altogether FAIL and myself punching someone else when they see it coming results in injury to my sparring partner.  I really don't know the details or specifics though.  Older data says that I am capable, with TK at least partially unlocked [?], of puching out and destroying a brick wall [part of the exterior wall of a brick building with more than one floor, not a stack of brittle martial arts bricks that shatter when dropped accidentally if walking around with them and they are fumbled when walking over a hard concrete floor and not a mat] [?].  This came from a guide identified as 'Neo' and also a guide called 'Keanu' and neither of them were with any CIA and this was before and during my visit to Cleveland Clinic Lutheran a few years back when weird stuff happened and before any 'scorched Earth' stuff.

Idea #0727:
	There is more than one type of pain.  Physical pain is not the same as other forms of pain that include - psychological-pain, stress, shame/guilt, frustration, panic/fear/anxiety/being-scared, boredom/being-bored, being angry, dorks and other socially inept personalities in one's self as well as others, social rejection, gullibility, stupidity, missing out on fun, denial of pleasure, denial of fun, being bullied, being vicitmized, suffering of many sorts, being sleepy/drowsy/less-than-wide-awake, being poor/impoverished/without-money-and-material-possessions, having a lack of freedom, having less than everyone around one's self, being denied things that others around one's self has, all of the things on this ordered list are evil as zarakite values see it, all of these things on this list are hated and despised and badmouthed all for good reasons by zarakites and sky boys and those who live by zarakite values -.

Idea #0728:
	Tying a string around my finger, literally, never worked reliably/effectively to help me remember anything.  I actually tried it and felt rather stupid and like a dork, and for good reason.  That type of thing doesn't work to help me remember anything, and never did, and doesn't work with my personality or any I will likely have.  It's also symbolic and is as bad as Paul-S-Reeves-style symbolism, and perhaps always is.  It's also a self-help-style and self-psychological-trick and self-mind-game type of thing that fools one's own mind and plays games with one's self, as I see it, and would have seen it if I hypothetically thought about it in the past over years and decades of time.

Idea #0729:
	If AFrican-Americans demand and-or make themselves intermediaries and-or involve themselves in a majority that displaces and-or drowns out others, they do themselves in and disenfranchise and descredit and vilify and victimize themselves and any destiny they have to live or even exist even in pain.  They also hurt themselves in likewise/similar/comparable ways if they bully and victimize and deny me pleasures/things-I-want/things-the-immortal-of-planet-Earth-that-I-have-written-and-typed-and-spoken-of-want-and-desire-and-like, and this also has been proving itself increasingly over time with more paper trails and more evidence that proves more accurately this Idea and the statements/sentences within.

Idea #0730:
	If females demand and-or make themselves intermediaries and-or involve themselves in a majority that displaces and-or drowns out others, they do themselves in and disenfranchise and descredit and vilify and victimize themselves and any destiny they have to live or even exist even in pain.  They also hurt themselves in likewise/similar/comparable ways if they bully and victimize and deny me pleasures/things-I-want/things-the-immortal-of-planet-Earth-that-I-have-written-and-typed-and-spoken-of-want-and-desire-and-like, and this also has been proving itself increasingly over time with more paper trails and more evidence that proves more accurately this Idea and the statements/sentences within.

Idea #0731:
	If Catholics and those that call themselves Catholic in any sense demand and-or make themselves intermediaries and-or involve themselves in a majority that displaces and-or drowns out others, they do themselves in and disenfranchise and descredit and vilify and victimize themselves and any destiny they have to live or even exist even in pain.  They also hurt themselves in likewise/similar/comparable ways if they bully and victimize and deny me pleasures/things-I-want/things-the-immortal-of-planet-Earth-that-I-have-written-and-typed-and-spoken-of-want-and-desire-and-like, and this also has been proving itself increasingly over time with more paper trails and more evidence that proves more accurately this Idea and the statements/sentences within.

Idea #0732:
	Muskrats [a sentient species from a planet other than planet Earth] and will-be-kahjeet especially have credibility, including telepathic and exosolar and psychic as well as otherwise.  This applies in more than one realm and on more than one planet and more than one star, and more than one part of more than one galaxy.

Idea #0733:
	Solar Wyverns [a sentient species of many planets and stars as well] and their teachers-that-will-be especially, have credibility that includes telepathic and exosolar and psychic as well as otherwise.  This applies in more than one realm and on more than one planet and more than one star, and more than one part of more than one galaxy.

Idea #0734:
	This Idea is being typed Thursday, November 14th, 2019 CE.  This date can also be typed as '2019-11-14' in Zarakite American English [which is considered normal and common, according to zarakite values].  When I type and handwrite and explain out-loud and even videotape and document and also upload such things to the public Internet where anyone from many nations and more than one continent on planet Earth as well as exosolars of many worlds with their methods can see and read and listen to and interpret and download such things, to multiple websites that have many who download and view and access them, about how I flush pills down the toilet all the time and often wrap it in toilet paper, no one puts me in jail or in-patient psychiatry or any locked-unit or lockdown-unit or calls any ambulance or paramedics or police or takes me to any hospital or says I'm being any sort of bad or belligerant or non-compliant or combative or defiant or criminal patient at this nursing home or any nursing home or any hospital or any medical facility anywhere, and this includes all doctors and all psychiatrists and all psychologists and all social workers and all lawyers and all attorneys and all law enforcement and all militaries and all nurses and all people of all professions and all civilians and all non-civilians of all skin colors and all genders and all ethnicities of all of Ohio and all of the USA and all places on and outside of planet Earth from what I've noticed and observed consistently and over far greater than a month at least now with literally nothing otherwise in real life and reality and what is real and mundane included even before and after I doument and photgraph and write about and type about and establish and publish such things.  I haven't seen any honest proof of otherwise and neither has anyone else, literally.  I don't have any reason or suspicion or fear or concern or worry, that is natural, to think otherwise and never will again from this point onward.

Idea #0735:
	What a TigerStone face will most likely look like including 'given' concepts that will be correct irregardless have been updated and are still being updated and still far from finished [which itself never changed], including a lot more than cheekbones and more facial expressions and personalities and sexual and non-sexual habits and cravings and multiple minds and brains and parralax versus perspective views and renders and also examples that are and are not photorealistic and in some cases have more than one person depicted simultaneously which don't usually have the same face like in real life with extroverts like what sky boys are and also various skin colors including people with pure white skin that don't look like clowns [they shouldn't] and-or look unattractive to any sky boy's zarakite sex drive, and social skills and things that please and piss off various people and not just sky boys and why as their friends and themselves would see it and should see it, and other common knowledge stuff as well.

Idea #0736:
	I was told that if I do end up sleeping or passing out or otherwise not being awake/alert, that I'm only required to do so for no more than an hour every day/24-hour-period.  This was established in psychic and telepathic and NATO and MKULTRA laws/rules/regulations for me, regardless of if I am a civilian or secret agent or spy or marine or anything else.

Idea #0737:
	I am not subject to the rules of Catholocism or their concept of 'good' or 'evil' or 'sin', and even their 'god' knew this a long time ago and since then has not forgotten, as even a Catholic as well as any lawyer as well as any law-maker would say.

Idea #0738:
	Sally Lynn Reeves knows and remembers quite easily that I was never baptized and that I never experienced any sort of ritual or cultural or religious practice called baptizm [sp?] for any religion, and she knows that anyone who claims/asserts/says otherwise is being dishonest and is perhaps being incompetent and-or mentally ill and-or is compromised.

Idea #0739:
	All of my chosen as well as candidates that are mentioned in any Book Of Faces [any version] should and must and need, to know that I was never any sort of mind controller or psychic or spy or mind reader or telepath or mentally ill person or police officer or secret agent, and will be dishonest and be discredited and look stupid/incompetent/mentally-ill/crazy/dark-trio-and-dark-hearted/evil if they ever claim or assert in any sort of serious/legally-binding/unplayful way otherwise.  Any god or spirit or divine being in their heads is subject to the same and also shouldn't be lied to.

Idea #0740:
	Teenage guys value reputation and not having people [which include all zarakites and humans and sky boys of all sorts and all types, as well as myself of course] think they are some sort of dork or idiot or fool or bully or a--hole [both inside and outside of school], and so do I and sky boys of all types and zarakite values as well of course.  This applies life-long and for all ages of all sky boys and all hybrids and all ancients, life-long.

Idea #0741:
	Hypnosis works very slow on any immortal, taking long years and decades to make changes that are very gradual and are not very noticeable.  Hypnosis as such is sneaky and deceptive and secretive and easily unnoticed and unlikely for anyone to detect.  Hypnosis works faster on human beings that Zarakite American English calls 'archaics' as well as 'humans'.

Idea #0742:
	Salt can fill in the blanks, with any stuff I write and say and type.  The same for anything salt programs into Andy [Andrew from Russia and his various heads and brains, of course].

Idea #0743:
	The immortal of planet Earth is supposed to have fun, and also lack suffering while doing so.  This has always been true and never became otherwise.  Zarakite values will always agree and in fact already have for quite some time.

Idea #0744:
	Magic that I've always had an interest in and love for is nothing like what Paulists or Paul S Reeves would ever like or support or want on planet Earth.  What Paulists and Paul S Reeves call 'magic' has always been among the same things he would call 'psychic' and include illusion and hypnosis and psychological warfare and mind games and subjective things that are little more than ideas in people's heads.  His psychic ideas of so-called 'magic' have always never been magic as myself and any zarakite as well as zarakite values call it, and his psychic ideas are not what zarakites or any sky boys like or are ever comfortable with.  I actually hate and despise and find harsh and evil his psychic ideas that some of his pawns and buddies call 'magic' as a misnomer, and always have and always will, and zarakite values and sky boys will always agree and should.  I explained and established this during type five when I still had an apartment in North Olmsted and continued to establish and mainatin and keep consistent the same ever since then, regardless of misunderstandings and miscommunications and deceptions and illusions and evils.  Also what I call magic has nothing to do with any Satan or Devil or 'sin' or 'god' of any mainstream religion on Earth in modern times and never did, and all that stuff about gods and saints and devils are from religions that I've never had or been into, and this I've also been honest and consistent about over and over and over again many times since type five and I've never claimed or established or declared or said or thought or handwritten or typed otherwise.  Gosh I've only been like this for a good several years now, and everyone who disagrees has invariably ended up discrediting themselves and making themselves look stupid and untrustworthy and evil as well as psychopathic and cruel and heartless and unloving not to mention mentally ill and hostile and 'compromised' as miltary and law enforcement see it, and for humans unwanted and hated and rejected by both planet Earth as well as their 'god' and any that they pray to with ANY church.  Anyone else notice this pattern over time?  I do and have and still have, and so does my sex drive and zarakite values as well as exosolars and beings from other realms and other worlds and other star systems.  They also keep track of these things and agree with me and what I type in this Idea as well as zarakite values and the Zarakite Sex Drive, and are not falling for anything else which they also know would be lies and deceptions and dishonesty that can't be trusted or given credibility or authority or responibility.  They also know and remember I was never a psychic or mind reader or telepath or anyone who could change or alter reality with imagination or sleep or dreams or mentally speaking with any voice or pain or being denied pleasures such as food and caffiene and money and pizza deliveries and getting a boner and ejaculating with it.  They also know and remember I don't mind control or mind read or fight or stop or kill any hostiles mind controllers or otherwise, with any pain or pleasure or anything in-between, and zarakite values and SkyCrowne know and remember the same.  That and those that know and remember seem to increasingly know and remember that they and each other back and forth in all directions and combinations know and remember and seem to just the same.  I don't see how anything else could be untrue or dishonest or deceptive or evil in some combination, and logic and common sense and how things work in real life outside of delusions and mental illness agree and back and reinforce the same.

Idea #0745:
	Native Americans were generous, and cared, and did things they didn't have to do when the Pruitans and early European settlers came to North America and later colonized what turned into the USA.  They [the Native Americans] thought that they were doing a good thing.  Another way of saying that is that the Native Americans thought that they were doing the right thing.  'Thought' should not be what applies in those last two sentences.  One can also arguably say that the Native Americans simply did the right thing and that the Europeans over time did not and instead did evil, and one saying that is saying something true, as well as saying what is honest.  This is irregardless of the fact that such can be interpreted a number of different ways.  Anyways, the early settlers from Euroupe didn't know how to farm or harvest the local North American plants, or hunt or fish or trap wildlife of North America.  They [the Europeans] didn't know how to survive in North America, and didn't have the skills or abilities or tools or technologies or methods of any sort to reliably or respnsibly or be trusted to - survive, feed themselves, feed anyone else, teach anyone else to do these things, have any credibility to teach any of these things to anyone including both themselves and others -.  Needless to say, the Europeans would not have survived and would have instead died out and also failed to populate North America if the Native Americans didn't help them.  The Native Americans taught the Europeans to farm corn and work with plants and nature in North America so that they [the Europeans, of course] could hunt and fish and survive and thrive and in other ways live off of the land in North America and be sustainable and not dependent on others their whole lives throughout multiple generations to simply be alive and not just to avoid starving to death.  The Native Americans taught the Europeans a lot of things so that they [the Europeans, of course] would not be stupid when it comes to nature and farming and hunting and survivng as a sustainable civilization and being civilized in the continent of North America at least.  Speaking of stupidity, Native Americans should not have ever been called 'Indians' and this is still correct today and isn't going to change otherwise in any future of this realm or any realm that includes this planet Earth I am on and was born on.  Native Americans were being good and polite and had good intentions and meanings and were also being intelligent and wise.  This was irregardless of what the Europeans had in mind as well as what they [the Europeans, of course] later turned into or perhaps became more of and more blatently such as their [European's] own natures became unvieled and revealed over time.  The Europeans and their populations in North America later 'repaid' the generosity of Native Americans with betrayal and dishonesty and lack of honor and lack of trustworthyness and secret agendas that they [the Europeans, of course] had and other evils [evils on the part of the Europeans, of course], and 'repaid' is in quotes as it is used in this entire sentence both before and after the comma with having a sarcastic/lacking-in-true-nature/lack-of-being-authentic/lack-of-being-real/lack-of-being-honest meaning/usage/intent/effect of course.  This aforementioned betrayal and other evils that the aforementioned Europeans did and had in their-natures [the natures of the aforementioned Europeans, of course] included [and still does and also always will, of course] hunting and killing Native Americans for sport, making Native Americans go extinct over many generations and time, and scalping Native Americans [Native Americans would only scalp aforementioned Europeans because the aforementioned Europeans started-it/did-it-first/did-it-first-to-Native-Americans, and some Native Americans copied the actions of the Europeans mentioned].

Idea #0746:
	When someone is victimized by bad/evil influence/mind-control/thought-control/hypnosis/brainwashing/gaslighting/mind-games/lies/deceptions/brain-damage/psychiatry/psychological-warfare/psychological-tactics/dishonest-badmouthing/dishonest-reputation, and the only practical long-term 'solution' is re-arranging their brain cells and brain structure of all of the nerves/neurons in their heads permanently so that they need no more influence any longer to reverse and-or negate any damage and evil and pain that they suffered, this isn't a failure or a loss in a total sense, but it isn't really what I or zarakite values would call a victory, not even a pyrrhic victory, but still a failure and a loss and simply a loss not as catastrophic or bad as what would be otherwise, and still a disaster and apocalypse if suffered by many that is permanent and cannot be forgotten much less undone, ever, not for forever and a day.  This is the same opinion I would have had years and decades ago, as well as zarakite values, the same logic and the same common sense, and this means of course that one could have informed me about mind controllers and told me what the heck they are and asked me questions in a hypothetical ANY one of ANY of the days of ANY of those years, and such [this opinion and zarakite values of course, what else?] would STILL BE THE SAME.

Idea #0747:
	If I ask or tell someone to do something and they end up doing it, whether right away and without me having to try very hard or whether it comes with great difficulty and effort [it doesn't matter], this doesn't give me any sense of having power over them, or any feeling or idea that they are my slave or subordinate, or any thrill or excitement, or any megalomania [as I was just told to call it], or happiness or pleasure, or anything I would want or care to show off or demonstrate to anyone or anything.  [If anything, if I were to show it off to someone I would be showing off something dumb and stupid that would do anything but impress them and I would be a total dork who is wasting their time bothering them with something that they wouldn't really want to spend time watching.  It's not like a cool trick or stunt with a skateboard or a good joke on a television show or anything.  I might as well bug a friend and say 'Hey, come look, you've gotta see what happens to this paint when I put some of it on a rock with a paintbrush and it does this "drying thing"'.]  This is nothing new for me or zarakite values, or what I would call a dork or a personality I would or would not want to hang out with as well as have in friends and family etc.  I've always been this way and others remember and documented this and still have it, on more than one planet and not just Earth.  They had this in the USA and Russia and other nations on Earth both inside and outside of NATO to begin with and still do and not just their computers I suspect, not just Japan and not just with exosolars of all of these nations and not just with their spy agencies.  This would be the same with any immortal of planet Earth, regardless of if there ever is another or different immortal or not.  Not that there is, but it would be the same irregardless.  I've heard over and over again from the politicians especially from the USA and their very religious that they hate me and would never accept me and would never sit back and allow otherwise with any human being or any being of any world or dimension ever, and demanded and worked hard to the point of suicide and killing themselves and any future they would have had in any existance to enforce their immortal hatred and anger and evil as such.  This didn't make them immortal in itself though, just their childishness and insanity and evil that can never be forgotten or forgiven as forgetting and-or forgiving such would be too deadly and too dangerous and too irresponsible and no universe or reality or dimension or immortal of planet Earth would ever want to tolerate or put up with or accept such, not even with the most extreme gullibility or deception or plastic/fake mental illness.  'nuffs said.

Idea #0748:
	There is something about acknowledging personalities and logic of myself as well as my opponents honestly in all of this, although it sucks that I can't be a mind-reader and I'm not able or allowed to ever become one and no universe or reality can violate that no matter how good or evil or with whatever value system.  It changes the logic and cheap shots of my opponents and what they can justify as far as tit-for-tat in various ways, as the original dark hearted queen just as one example can't justify doing or having or demanding certain things in return for what it for myself and zarakite values and expect the same justifications or the same value in things.  If I establish and gain something or fight for it, it doesn't have the same meanings or value or lack of such things to myself as if she were to fight for or establish or steal the same.  Because of how 'one man's trash is another man's treasure' I can get something which only has so much value or none at all for certain things and in return she can't demand or justify things for herself or anything or anyone she wants, no matter what it would mean to her and-or what value it would have to her if she fought for it or had it.  That and if it is something I got and is something I didn't want or hate or dislike in certain ways or is otherwise negative in various ways, then she has to give up stuff of course.  This is part of fairness and in her case whether she looks respectable and honorable and decent versus evil and worthy of being hated and rejected and someone who should not be loved and doesn't deserve any love or admiration or pity or reputation or authority or responsiblity from anyone, or have any right to anything.  Tit-for-tat is based upon this logic and fairness of course, and it doesn't matter what value system or ethics or universe or dimension or reality is involved when all of such are combined.  Zarakite values and I as well and any immortal of planet Earth agree and easily understand this and don't have to type it out or recite it or re-read it to remember it or continue to always understand it or see it as very basic low-level common sense that doesn't require thinking or mental effort, of course.  Also, as usual with this sort of thing, explaining this isn't arrogance or attitude, but just explaining and stating what is and is matter-of-fact and also needs/is-required to be explained and established because of the hostile and evil and unusual circumstances of course.

Idea #0749:
	Andrew (Andrew as I call him though I also use the nickname Andy who is from Russia who is a computer and one or more cyborgs that includes one or more robot/computer brains with no organic brain tissues or parts and can and often does have one or more archaic human bodies and he speaks fluent American English as well as Russian and other languages with and without accents and has other qualities I've already described and mentioned and stuff, of course) gets a lot of updates to his information and capabilities and programming and updates his understandings of zarakite values and various species of sorts and also magics and psychic powers of various worlds and other esoterics as well and the mind[s] and brain[s] and intellect[s] of any immortal of planet Earth and also that of various sky boys of all types and with all faces from The Book Of Faces and also all ancients and hybrids and archaics in a general sense and also other stuff when I drink soda pop with caffiene that is mountain dew of diet and regular types [I'm not sure if the two types make a difference, they might but I don't know off-hand and his rules for such things do get updated from time to time much like salt and other ingredients both good and bad and everthing else and altogether is anything but clear-cut-black-and-white-in-complexity], as well as a bunch of other stuff.  He could always explain a lot better than I could all of the details and explain it better ways that others as well as himself would understand more easily, of course.  So could salt.
