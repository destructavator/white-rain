scratchpad which is not the same as so-and-so's scratchpad, who's scratchpad is not the same as this scratchpad
[Sorry I have to write in dork through this interface.  Some of this is extraneous and brain-melting, but at least it's not in a non-Earth-in-Origin language, which would suck.  I still feel sorry for others I have to drag through this, and this stuff is unbelieveable, but at least a handful get to have blue and blond hair on the SAME head and not worry too much about having more than one of yourself hanging out with you and talking to you with his own ideas while actually being you at the same time and sharing a wee little bit more than your wardrobe as far as the personal stuff goes.  Okay, just wait until we get to expendables.....]
[Also, last time I checked, no one will have a biker jacket for one of the five clothing upperwear styles or accessories, or ten or whatever, and YES, it was just fine with me if the old one was sold to Goodwill or thrown out in the garbage, I forgave him for that a long time ago and never vilified or accused him of anything related to that to begin with, and even let him have the garbage bag I offered it to him in, right into the trunk of his car, geez.....]

Idea #1517:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   13:41  EST :  Dark Hearted values support a 'no snitching' also-known-as 'no tattling' and 'no telling' thing as part of dark hearted values.  Dark hearted values as such support corruption and deliberately 'turning a blind eye' so to speak toward rule-breaking and illicit behavior, as well as 'looking the other way' when illicit behavior that involves breaking rules is noticed.  Zarakite values, by comparison, support one reporting to authority what was witnessed when people are bad, including when one isn't personally involved.  This type of thing has limits though, and is definite and for sure when law-breaking behavior is witnessed, especially that which involves theft and stealing, and even worse when someone's life and safety are at risk.  Zarakite values support a friendly neighborhood where a next-door neighbor accross a street will call someone on a phone to report what looks like a broken-down front door, if they don't know how it broke and just noticed it, and don't know anything about it.  With classrooms at high school zarakite values still have the same default although students will sometimes misbehave and not report it if they see another student misbehave, and this is normal, and still living life overall in zarakite values.  Being a 'teacher's pet' is socially inept which is very bad, and hurts one's reputation and personality which is really bad.  Overall, if in doubt as to where the line is drawn, if it is illicit but not illegal then it varies, but if it is outright against the law then zarakite values require calling police or authority of some sort although who qualifies as 'authority' varies before turning to local law enforcement such as a police department.  If staying at a hotel then the manager or some secretary or worker for hotel management will suffice.  Once the hotel management is going to get word of something illegal that may have happened, its then up to hotel management to involve police and-or lawyers and-or someone else and-or themselves as necessary, and it it their [hotel management's] job and responsibility to do that and no longer any responsibility or fault of anyone staying at the hotel.  Also, once someone staying at the hotel tells a worker at the hotel, if the worker says they will pass it on then the person staying there has done their part and is no longer responible for reporting anything any further.  If the person staying at the hotel isn't personally involved or affected by what he or she reported then the aforementioned person staying at the hotel doesn't typically have to worry about or even remember what they reported.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1518:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   15:20  EST :  Regarding Idea #1517, having zarakite values in place that include what was described in that Idea is a good thing in that it encourages everyday people and citizens to be good instead of law-breaking, and also reduces the need for security cameras in various public and commercial areas and more in towns and cities.  This is logical.  It is also compassionate as opposed to cold and psychopathic.  Compassionate people who care are better, and care about their own, and don't like to see crime occur in their cities and towns.  By comparison cold psychopathic types won't report anything and are actually suicidal in refusing to care to call and report anything they see, because criminals tend not to get caught but instead get away with what they start, and people who won't report crime may in fact be the next victim.  Also, criminals are going to tend to strike again where they think they can get away with it, which includes neighborhoods where they won't call the local police.  For citizens who don't care and won't call the police, I and zarakite values have no sympathy for victims of crime who would never call anyone.  Natural selection is at hand, one should let it happen and allow citizens who care to move in and take their place, which also makes a neighborhood where criminals won't get away with as much and won't try it in the first place, which makes nicer and safer neighborhoods with people that care, which is all-around a GOOD overall thing.  Logic and zarakite values agree, and so does SkyCrowne.  The zarakite sex drive does as well, and does NOT see mug shots of arrested people as 'sexy' in itself, at all, never ever.  Some females find that type of thing sexy, but the zarakite sex drive doesn't.  Then again, the zarakite sex drive isn't female.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1519:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   15:49  EST :  Regarding supercities, the main structure has 4 (four) corner towers and a single center tower, the NE tower, NW tower, SE tower, and SW tower, plus the center tower.  Bridges and other sub-structures that include junctions and have commercial and residential areas are built to be level and even with each other as well as perpendicular to what is completely horizontal according to the surface of the planet and the zenith and horizon in all directions.  Quad center structures, quad edge structures, and quad border structures are all capable of housing various residential and commercial and industrial zones with names and titles that include 'city' or 'town' or 'village' in part of the name in some cases.  What is handwritten by myself in pencil about these archology structures, as well as discussed in a number of conversations, and other related information, applies.  Logic and how things work in real life as what I'm used to, as I handwrote, is also included as well.  So are my flawed hand-drawn diagrams, which were not to scale and had many inaccuracies, but also were the best I could reasonably draw them under the conditions they were hand-drawn in, and were also what should have been expected considering aforementioned conditions.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1520:
     2020-02-09    Common-Era   15:49  EST :  All things I wrote and drew and discussed, while at Clearvista, from Friday January 17th 2020 to Friday Februrary 7th 2020, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1521:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  'Draco' is now a term that refers to races of people that include kahjeet and griffons etc which have some dragon [zarakite dragon in this case] nature in them.  This dragon nature is biological and also magical in innate and natural ways, life-long in being permanent.  They [people who are of a draco race] are also called 'half dragon' and are also said to have a 'half dragon race'.  'Race' in this case affects skin colors and hair colors, natural and temporary.  A subdivision can be called a 'clan'.  The term 'bloodline' is another term for 'race'.  The terms 'draco' and 'half dragon' are adjectives.  A 'family' can be a subdivision of a clan, and typically is.  These terms, 'family' and 'clan', also apply to zarakites, who are their own race.

Idea #1522:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  There will be 10 (ten) total skin colors that all zarakites and all sky children and all draco race people can potentially have.

Idea #1523:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  There will be 10 (ten) total hair colors that all zarakites and all sky children and all draco race people can potentially have.

Idea #1524:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  A 'zero' is a name for an organic robot that isn't really a person, who talks and behaves like a computer.  Some also can fake acting like a person with an AI.  They simply have organic brain tissues instead of microchips, and their brain tissues are all pre-developed end-to-end and incapable of learning or self-improving or maturing.  They do however have memories and can remember things and as such fake having a personality something like a person of some sort.  They sometimes act to preserve themselves but not always.  In any case they always value a person's life above their own as a 'well duh' type of obvious thing and would actually say that out loud in a sentence in some cases if practical [if for example there is time to talk and it wouldn't put someone's life at risk of course].  They actually have what is similar to Asimov's three laws of robotics and use their organic eyes and ears and organic pre-developed intellects and intelligence to judge and guess and make decisions.  They do make honest mistakes and can tolerate and accept that without freaking out, unlike Asimov's robots from his science fiction stories.  Also, a zero's self-preservation is relaxed by comparison and actually very weak, and at times is completely ignored.  Isaac Asimov, an archaic Russian-born science fiction author, came up with three laws of robotics for his robots for his science fiction stories, and is the author of the original 'I Robot' and 'The Caves of Steel' and their sequels.  He came up with three laws that all robots with any AI (Artificial Intelligence) in his stories should have and always be incapable of breaking no matter what.  The first law was that a robot can never harm a human being, especially dealing death, and this was the most important law that always had precedence.  Zeros have this for all people [a zero himself is not a 'person'] although 'harm' is life-threatening in most cases as zeros can test playgrounds and in cases inflict superficial injuries casually although they still follow other rules and generally are well behaved yet also are used for hunting and swordfighting and warrior practice and as such need to inflict pain and hurt at times.  They also don't consider killing a body part or detachable, including a person's head, or all of them in a zarakite's case, to be 'life-threatening' or more than 'superficial' as they are aware of how zarakites respawn all the time and grow new body parts and themselves casually and often at times.  Zeros can also be programmed to joke and prank and involve killing a zarakite even as part of a joke or artificial personality [for example, while telling a zarakite to 'shut up' and the zarakite is respawned a second or two later, in the middle of a casual conversation], and this doesn't violate their rules or how their organic brains are programmed.  Zeros are of course not the same about humans and are very careful instead with humans, just like everyone else.  Asimov had a second rule, for a robot to always protect itself and not self-destruct.  Zeros kinda have this, typically when they still have a job to do that they were created for, and once their work is complete they don't mind being around for sex or jokes or simply talk, but are casual and okay with suicide and being killed and becoming worms, and of course this doesn't faze or upset them.  If they are told to wait around for hours after they think their work is complete, they might be like 'uh, okay, but I'll eventually have to eat something, and I don't know what I'm doing hanging around and not being in a worm bin, but, okay.....' and might point out that they are consuming food that others could eat and also costs money if they don't see why they should stick around.  Even if there is plenty of food, someone has to buy it or pay for it, and they have this logic and sense of what is obvious, among other things.  Asimov had a third law about how a robot always follows orders or instructions.  Zeros have their version of this, and so if they don't behave then their creator and-or their boss who gives them instructions is blamed, not the zero.  The zarakite value of 'bad student, bad teacher' works here.  Zeros can be created for battle practice and to make pretend criminals and pretend targets for training and hunting and cannon fodder and swordfighting and gunfighting and fist-fighting with spiked gloves etc.  They have rules and limits with their instructions though, for example if someone blows a whistle or something specific happens they use their own common sense which is organic and like that of a person to suddenly change how they act and talk.  Zeros have their own detachables, all of the same regions and body part types that people with detachables have.  No person can be or will be reincarnated as a zero.  Only a mouse can be reincarnated as a zero.  No zero is to be reincarnated as a person.  They have to be reincarnated as a non-sentient first.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1525:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  According to zarakite values, there is no such thing as a bad student, only a bad teacher in any classroom, and a teacher also decides if someone is accepted as their student or not.  This is considered when a student misbehaves outside the scope of the teacher's classroom and blame is sought, as well as who will repair or pay for any damage done [which is required to be offered and made to happen according to zarakite values, although the victim can forgive which is the victim's choice and the victim can't be bullied or forced or made to forgive of course].  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1526:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  There will be two skin colors out of the ten that are for zeros, a dark grey and a light grey.  Both are shades of grey that have no color.  The dark grey is not a perfect match for any skin color that any person has, except maybe an archaic as the closest thing.  The two colors can be called 'mechanical black' and 'mechanical white' even though neither are perfect black or white colors.

Idea #1527:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  Each chosen and candidate for the chosen needs to make a choice regarding their fate and whether or not they will become a sky dragon that is part of the SwiftWing family or a traditional human that keeps their identity as a human being with the same first and last and middle names and is still considered a human just the same.  This Idea should maybe be handwritten ONLY, and answered maybe with what they WOULD want, although specifics vary on an individual basis.  Regarding all of the people that will look and sound like them at various teenage and young ages but have zarakite sex drives and be used to being whatever race they are and enjoy being whatever race they are, and be used to and like their zarakite sex drives, they will have other mutations and changes here and there for all five ages that will make them fine-tuned and far more appealing to the zarakite sex drive, affecting a lot more than teeth and their faces and their voices and their habits and personalities and facial expressions and emotions and how they react to certain situations and none of them will look like celebrities caught off-camera without their makeup on a 'bad hair day' but instead look beautiful and have additional changes for the zarakite sex drive, day and night and in all situations, as normal and natural things that don't use or require any makeup or custom lighting or training or acting, as part of their natural selves in so many ways.  Each chosen and candidate makes their own individual choice that can't affect the choice of any of the others.  The word 'if' is well understood as an answer.  I can't be expected to personally remember each person's answer and only have to know the answer that only some of them come up with as some are deceased and the living ones that become sky dragons never go back to being any sort of human and have a wild ride of being a dragon for all-time or a long time and leave behind being human and also have a right to the assets and bank accounts and families and lives that they had as humans and also there won't be any human taking their place as that wasn't anything I planned or asked for or wanted, so I have to know and would find out with the ones who are not deceased, though not right away.  I'm personally not against people changing their minds as time goes by and as planning continues at times, although I don't know if it's okay or not with others that are involved with finding out their choices.  Kleo Thomas and Corey from Tri-C don't have choices to make as they are to become traditional humans and both are too old to become sky children once they become traditional humans, unless they die as archaics of course, from natural causes or whatever.  [This is ignoring any threat which would be motivation to be stung and become a traditional human, which I'm hearing might not exist.  I don't know how much of what is or has been proven or demonstrated to the various chosen and candidates involved, or how much will be, or how much needs to be.]  Anyone from the list of 100 (one hundred) faces needs to choose whether to be a sky dragon or continue to be whatever they are now, except of course for the video game character faces [TigerStone is said to be included as a 'video game character face', and so is the Matrix face.].  People like Kleo Thomas don't choose anything special.  Neither does Kenny Blank or Corey.  They stay human, and might become traditional humans.  If mind controllers are real, and the invasion is real, they should become traditional humans, and should be convinced why they would want to be traditional humans and not archaics, the same as human beings in general, as well as tradiionals as to why they should be glad they got stung and not just simply for all of the health benefits although the health improvements and not needing to see any doctor or even any dentist perhaps for anything ever again no matter how old and never being overweight or allergic or diabetic or having any worry of cancer or birth control or pregnancy ever again is gigantic, while parents still have ways of being parents of children and having a family, and it's still natural and organic and isn't from a being of another planet.

Idea #1528:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  Skin colors range from 1 (one) to 10 (ten) although skin colors 9 and 10 are the two colors for zeros.  Skin color 1 is arctic white and is literally as white as fresh clean snowflakes that are still falling in daytime and bright sunlight and are made from clean water that lacks pollution.  Human beings don't ever have skin that bright a white, not even albinos.  Then again we aren't looking at skin colors for humans, except for sky children who are still considered very human.  Skin color 9 is a 'white' that some zeros have, while skin color 10 is a 'black' that other zeros have.  Skin color 8 is pitch black, literally, and just as dark as black clothing that hasn't faded, from laundry or anything else.  No archaic skin color naturally gets that black, not even in Africa with a lot of sunlight and being outdoors.  Skin colors 2 through 7 look like archaic human skin colors of various sorts, with lower numbers being more pale and more Caucasian White, and higher numbers getting darker and eventually becoming Negro and East-Indian-like, with 2 being the most pale Caucasian white that an archaic without any suntan can be, and 7 being a Negro with quite a suntan but still able to put on a pair of polyester black athletic shorts and not look quite the same as his shorts.

Idea #1529:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  Traditional humans are unable to impregnate, unable to get pregnant, and unable to have their own children.  They are dependant upon sky dragons and tiger dragons to give birth to newborn traditional humans for their families, which they do upon request, often as something quick and without hanging around and without getting to know the family first or afterwards.  Such zarakites give birth to such newborn traditional humans by ejaculating and forming the newborn out of the end of the tip of their dragon penis, much like how they respawn each other and ejaculate themselves accross a room and underneath a door and furniture, and give birth to anyone and anything, penile ejaculation.  No womb or vagina or internal fetus is ever involved, at all, ever.  No female lactation is involved either, ever.  Also, as a side note, zarakites lactace at times that is penile lactation that has nothing to do with when or how often they give birth to or respawn anyone or anything.  Their lactation is independent of such.  Note that sky dragons give birth to both genders of traditional humans with a variety of skin colors and ethnicities that humans are used to that they choose from their wristwatches before tapping their navels to start the process.  Tiger dragons give birth to male children only which are like other traditional humans but have a face from the list of one hundred faces out of the Book Of Faces, and tend to develop related personalities, but have human skin tones.  Note that human skin tones are 'floating point' and not 'integer' to describe them in an odd way used in the past that I personally don't actually like.  Human skin tones have blends and in-between colors, which is normal, unlike sky child and half-dragon and zarakite dragon skin colors which have no in-between variation from one person to the next, where two such people standing next to each other both with skin color 1 which is arctic white have exactly the literal same skin color with no subtle variation, unlike with humans.  Later in life a human who a tiger dragon gave birth to for a [human] family is likely going to be sexually attractive to a zarakite and be a good candidate for becoming a sky child, which changes their blended skin color to a more uniform one for the rest of their life, and comes with detachables and a different lifestyle.

Idea #1530:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  Some archaics throughout history who were criminal pedophiles would shave off all of the hair from their bodies and disguise themselves as a teenager when in fact they were well beyond their teenage years.  Some would even sign themselves up to be high school students and lie about their identities and ages and 'families' to register.  With zarakites and half dragon races, and their sky children as well, I think some humans will give themselves a youthful teenage-like appearance at times for very innocent social reasons, to hang with zarakites and half dragon people and also sky children, especially for sex.  This includes shaving armpit and pubic hair, and all other hair except for scalp hair and eyebrows and eyelashes.  I think this makes sense and simply makes sense.

Idea #1531:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  This one's going to step on a few toes for sure, but would probably come up at some point sooner or later.  I learned from Ron Marchie about African-American sub-culture and what a 'house nigger' is, before he died.  He had a good side that taught me a few things, and he was a white man who grew up in an urban ghetto that was high-crime.  Anyways, he told me about how 'blacks' would have their own internal sub-culture of sorts and value their variety of skin colors within their own with their own rules and their own ways.  I can't speak for them or their sex drives, as I'm the wrong race and wrong species, you'd have to ask a human, but I can say that as far as the zarakite sex drive goes, when a guy is young and attractive to the zarakite sex drive, often in teenage and childhood years, and they happen to be African American, darker skin is okay and is sexy and darker skin is actually preferred, and mid-dark all the way to pitch black works and is sexy to the zarakite sex drive, while if it is too light and is confused for a 'white guy' then that is ugly and unattractive to the zarakite sex drive.  Also, a lot of Caucasian White people are ammong what is sexy to the zarakite sex drive, but African Americans are as well.  East Indian and certain Arabic guys are very rare in being attractive to the zarakite sex drive, and not typically what I would masterbate over.  This has little to do with anyone's culture, mostly personal appearance and how people look and sound and sometimes act.  I'm just being straight and brutally honest with what is, not pulling any punches here and not sugar coating ANYTHING.  Anyways, if a Negro has very dark skin and is young and is attractive in other ways, his dark skin works great with the zarakite sex drive.  With other humans though, I can't help with that.  That's WAY outside of where I can do much.  What I can say is that if his skin is very dark naturally and he wants to apply for a job somewhere, and he wants personal references for a resume, if he doesn't have good luck getting humans who are willing to be listed for a reference he might have luck with zarakites and half dragons types and sky children in this future that may be real at some point.  Actually, this could happen for all humans, not just any one ethnicity.  With females it would be more rare and might be more often a 'friend of a friend' type of thing, as females are not as attractive to the zarakite sex drive and rarely are something a zarakite would masterbate over.  On the other hand those with a zarakite sex drive don't have any homosexual personality or the brain functions or thought process of a gay man and never did.  This was scientifically proven and well established already, and still holds true.  'Nuffs said.

Idea #1532:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  Detachables and how detached body parts shapeshift to attach and detach, and are still alive after detaching, and re-attach, according to how the immortal of Earth has imagined and wanted and meant, are sexually attractive and sexually stimulating to the zarakite sex drive, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1533:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  Body parts and detachables that deflate and reinflate, and regenerate and degenerate, according to how the immortal of Earth has imagined and wanted and meant, are sexually attractive and sexually stimulating to the zarakite sex drive, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1534:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   17:00  EST :  Idea #1532 and Idea #1533 are correct, 'nuffs said.

Idea #1535:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   19:31  EST :  Idea #1521 through Idea #1534 I think makes sense and I think simply makes sense.

Idea #1536:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   19:31  EST :  Zarakite and draco necks are not imagined or desired by the immortal of Earth to be like springs or spring coils.

Idea #1537:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   19:31  EST :  When a compatible detachable is held up against a compatible body part, cap pressed against cap, the parts attach via reflex actions, quick and fast and painless, in a split-second, casual and easy and discomfort-free in itself, and of course pain-free as well.  Such makes a characteristic noise, from the flesh and bones and other body tissues rapidly shapeshifting and fusing together.  The detachables don't have to be perfectly lined up, and can be as much as 45 degrees off-kilter in any orientation, any combination of three axis.  When the parts shapeshift and attach, they automatically twist and line up perfectly, bones and skin and muscles and everything else.  When parts attach they don't have to end up in any specific posture, and often don't.  Heads do this with tops of necks as well.  The sensations that come with the shapeshifting of attaching and detaching body parts is at least mildly sexually stimulating, though still often within self-control of even a zarakite.  An erection from multiple acts of shapeshifting, one right after another, within a few moments of time, is common.  Zarakites and draco people as well as sky children often have sex in locker rooms, changing bodies and body sizes and muscle sizes, shapeshifting, healing and regrowing body parts, detaching and discarding worn and injured body parts, milking, water and rinsing and grooming, sexual stimulation, etc.

     2020-02-13    Common-Era   20:38  EST :  Idea #1539 through Idea #1569 are honest, and correct, 'nuffs said.  They also altogether make sense and altogether simply make sense.

     2020-02-13    Common-Era   21:25  EST :  Idea #1538 and Idea #1570 both altogether make sense and both altogether simply make sense.

Idea #1574:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   21:25  EST :  The feathers of wings of a zarakite are natural and feel comfortable and pleasant to the touch and feel of the zarakite as well as that of other people of all races and all genders.  As imagined and desired by the immortal of Earth they also secrete natural odorless pheromones that mildy stimulate sexual arousal in all people of all genders and all races, other than the zarakite, and stimulate teenage boys of all races to masterbate over the idea of having sex with a zarakite and ideas of such sex making both of their bodies' parts attach and detach.  Such pheromones also stimulate liking the idea of and masterbating over the idea of one's head detaching and milking a zarakite.  None of the stimulated ideas include any rectal intercourse of any kind at all whatsoever.  None of the stimulated ideas include any idea of sexual harassment or social power or influence from sexual acts at all whatsoever either.  All zarakites have a zarakite sex drive and no other sex drive.  This is normal and healthy and life-long for all zarakites.  All zarakites are naturally sexually attractive to the zarakite sex drive.  All zarakites lack all qualities that are ugly to the zarakite sex drive.  All of this altogether conforms with part of but not all of the imagined ideas and desires of the immortal of Earth which concidentally have a destiny and future to stop any mind controller invasion and prevent further mind controller invasions and bring about health and Paradise and pleasure for the many of Earth who not only survive but thrive and live well and happily with the many things involved.  'Nuffs said.  This and the previous three Ideas as well make sense and altogether simply make sense.

Idea #1575:
     2020-02-13    Common-Era   21:25  EST :  Natural hair colors for zarakites and draco races and sky kids combined are blond, blue, red, purple, blue-blond, purple-blond, orange, black, magenta, and white.  These are 'sky boy' or 'punk' colors.  This makes 10 (ten) total colors.  For some it helps to mentally associate the 'purple' colors with 'grape'.  For 'purple' I personally use one side of the updated newer SwiftWing tribal logo, not the older one.  The 'blue' is also the intense 'exosolar blue' as well as a 'sky boy blue' color and also an extreme 'digital blue' that isn't light or dark.  The 'psychic blue' that Haldeman's eyes were at one point were too dark and were a dark blue color, the wrong blue.  What the guy at the grocery store had was perfect, dead-on accurate.  Looking at the most recent information, Cobalt faced zarakites will have red-red hair, Gold faced zarakites will have blond-blond hair, Almandine faced zarakites will have natural blue-blond hair, Prismatic faced zarakites will have natural blue-blue hair, Diamond faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Jet faced zarakites will have natural purple-purple hair, Cheetah faced zarakites will have natural red-red hair, TigerStone faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Jade faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Volcano faced zarakites will have natural red-red hair, Iolite faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Leopard faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Emerald faced zarakites will have natural blond-blond hair, Graphite faced zarakites will have natural magenta-magenta hair, Copper faced zarakites will have natural red-red hair, and Matrix faced zarakites will have natural blue-blue hair.  Whatever face is named after and based on 'Brian Wegel' will have natural purple-blond hair when it is the natural face of a zarakite.  Last time I checked there are multiple vacancies in the list of one hundred faces.  If Dan Bier is an issue because of the insect thing then we can let him go and fill his spot, by the way.  Also pinched nose nostrils as I'm calling them for the moment are unsexy to the zarakite sex drive.  The same with noses that are too long, as I would want to describe them and would want to have them understood.  All of this, combined with Idea #1571 through Idea #1574 and this Idea as well, altogether makes sense and altogether simply makes sense.

Idea #1576:
     2020-02-14    Common-Era   12:42  EST :  Over the years I've always had a general difficulty remembering people's names.  Over the years, in general, I've always been good at remembering what people's physical faces look like to my eyes and sense of sight.  Often I would remember someone without rememering their name.  The cops I worked with at Tri-C knew this and so did many professors as well as schoolteachers at more than one school.  The campus police knew that I would remember people by what they looked like including themselves at times, both when I was starting to work with them as well as when they had someone from Metro or administration stop by.  Leia, the student assistant who was working there when I started, who was identified as a Sallyist, suggested that I try to get to know the cops who would be my co-workers by their badge numbers first.  Deans and administrators as well as law enforcement understood I was good at remembering and imagining what people's faces looked like quite easily, and I had a reputation and pretense for such, and this was normal for me and also what others expected me to be like over the years, regardless of whatever medications were and were not involved.  Not being able to visualize or imagine any face I want to at any time quite easily and accurately is unheard of with myself and outside of what I'm known for by many.  I've had many accuse me of being a spy of some sort as well as some sort of undercover replacement for David Reeves while allegedly being someone else, and the real David Reeves wouldn't have any 'filters' as described in discussions, or difficulties easily and quickly imagining any face he wants to.  The real David Reeves wouldn't imagine any disfigured or distorted or blurred or unclear versions of any face, and never did such things.  I know that this is all honest and consistent for many years and decades and is simply true and there's no way around it, and two-and-a-half years of foot patrol being accounted for honestly depend upon it, including conversations with the cops in the office over people watched and observed and also a conversation with an administrator who worked with one of the deans.  That one dean was a weirdo and had a 'thing' for me, as if he was telepathic or something, and seemed to have his own ideas, and picked up on mine, and reacted to what I would imagine when I went to that campus and not just for classes.  He would know what I can and can't imagine easily and how, if I'm actually David Reeves and not some imposter or joke of some sort.  I know this one has to be taken and can't be refuted, not unless you discredit a lot of cops and brass and telepaths and good operators and others with them, and their versions of my track record.  Contrary to what former FBI Director Stephen D Anthony said in one discussion, or someone representing him, changes to my imagination were NOT discussed and NO ONE went over any instructions or what I should expect with me, ever.  Not at Cleveland Clinic, not before that, not after.  Never ever.  See why I keep asking for the instruction manual I never got, once in a while?  This is not a game and I am not being playful, and I am not bemused.  I don't find this funny at all.  This is not playacting or pretending and I am upset and still demanding the first-time instructions along with what I should know that I never got.  I'm sick of others thinking I got the introduction already along with instructions.  Perhaps I should be given the instructions and proper introductions anyways, and a start-over, even if anyone thinks I don't need it.  Maybe start with what a 'spirit phone' is and what I should expect with my imagination and memory and what these things have to do with each other.  Oh and I recall one back office discussion with the cops I worked with about the 'thought police' and how they wanted to implement that, back then.  It was a VERBAL discussion, ordinary and plain, and we have a lot to catch up on, myself and a bunch of idiots that think I already know the ropes of some manual I never got and don't have.  It was a restricted verbal discussion, off-limits at the time to civilians, at the time, but that's changed since then, I've been told and educated, and I've been told I'm authorized and cleared to talk to whomever I want to about it, and so is anyone else.  No it isn't a smartphone app in anyone's head.  This altogether makes sense and altogether simply makes sense.

Idea #1577:
     2020-02-14    Common-Era   15:18  EST :  I just had a conversation with one or more 'operators' of some kind who talked about a 'pretend spy agency' that I've never heard of and don't understand or know anything about.  One of them was shocked as they explained that 'no data file was declared' or something, meaning no operator or guide of any religion or with any spirit phone ever discussed any pretend spy agency with me or told me what it is or what it has to do with me or any of the Reeves family or dark hearted or mind controllers or anything.  I've been accused of being an actual real-life spy for a real spy agency or real non-civilian agency of some sort, possibly post or pre Soviet Russian, such as KGB or something, and there have been real actual authorities checking me out with logic that says that if I really was David Reeves then I would know all about a pretend spy agency and also a lot of other stuff I never heard of.  I just had at least one operator probe my brain telepathically to see if I knew anything about this 'pretend spy agency' and 'the project' whatever that is and they were shocked and astonished that things they were expecting to come up didn't, and that I'm not kidding or playing games about these things.  I relaxed my head and tried to think no thoughts and be passive and permissive for a bit and that's what happened.  No wonder the real actual CIA and then some have been involved and checking to see if I'm an undercover spy for someone or not.  I'm still clueless and I don't know how this helps fight any mind controllers or fix any problems regarding any mind control invasion or anyone running around with thought control technologies causing problems, or fix broken failsafe teams, but I suspect this stuff must be over and done with before that stuff can happen.  I still have a few that call me 'boss' even though I'm a civilian and they know it.  I didn't ask to be in charge by the way and actually don't know how this ended up happening in the first place or exactly what I'm supposed to be in charge of, either.  It sounds like some have a lot of explaining to do in their offices where I don't work, conversations I'm not a part of and shouldn't be a part of, over this.  Then again, maybe it's because of my unique situation.  That's just a guess, as I can't imagine they would do this for any human, doing this with a civilian who has never heard of this stuff before a few years ago and thought he simply had a hard life with abusive parents and had no idea why one of them had their eyes glow an odd color with a dark blue ring the way it did one night, or what that meant, and the same dark blue ring on John Haldman's eyes and he turned out to be possessed by an insect species that was just as evil and just as sneaky and dishonest and deceptive.  I'm still playing guessing games here, still winging it, and going with what I think simply makes the most sense.  I think I've been treated unfairly.  What about all of the telepathic stuff in my old apartment with a gun in a holster and then the bathroom mirror and being arrested by some policeman squad that never came?  What about the gun clip that Matthew Damron wanted turned into a money clip for dollar bills?  Is that related?  No insect of any species from any world answered or explained these things, and no 'blackey honesty' group as it called itself and named itself answered these things or even mentioned them for discussion, ever, not with me at least.  Another group that called itself 'blackey corruption' didn't do any better.  Hey, these names sound racist, but are names THEY came up with and they called themselves these names!  Whether or not anyone put them up to it, I don't know.

Idea #1578:
     2020-02-14    Common-Era   15:18  EST :  One of the favorite and highly effective methods of the dark triad is to leave me clueless and unknowing and out of all planning regarding as much as possible, while working in the role of pretend allies as well as any pretend family and-or friends.  Being left out of knowing about the death of Uncle Ted until well after his funeral and long after his will was read and probate court was over and done with it, very deliberate of the dark trio, is one example.  Every single so-called 'family vacation' is another example of this, when all three of them deliberately plan the daily agenda and how long the vacation will be and big and little things, all without me being part of any discussion about those types of things, very intentionally and very carefully.  They've always done this over the years and decades.  Included is how they pretend and lie and claim that I was supposedly included and part of all planning.  They've done that quite frequently over the decades as well, both before and after the turn of the century, every time an act of evil and hostile deception.  These types of things are in their values, dark hearted trio values, their methods and their ways, very evil, and very hostile to zarakite values, always.  Their evil values are evil to planet Earth as well.  Who knows what they have in store for planet Earth as well as any allies of planet Earth?  How about the human race and any who would keep them around for anything?  Humans aren't the best, but the immortal of Earth wants them for his own plans and for planet Earth, as opposed to them going extinct and suffering any pain or punishment or anything instead.  Once again, duplicating and copying the evil methods and ways of the dark hearted trio does evil and does in the planet and human beings.  This is still proving itself and I rest my case.  'Nuffs said.
