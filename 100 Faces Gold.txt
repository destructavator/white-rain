<p align="left">Gold is a face that - tiger dragons, sky dragons, male wind dragons, male sky children - can have.</p>

<p align="left">Gold-faced - tiger dragons, sky dragons, wind dragons, sky children, prophecy children - love to be the target of a good prank, and love even more to prank someone back in return to get their revenge.  They also don't mind being ragged on by their friends and family.  They also love it when one of their friends or family grabs them and gives them a good noogie, as well as similar physical acts of horseplay.  Needless to say, they naturally enjoy a good brawl.  They tend to be very bright intellectually as well as socially intelligent, and rather perceptive and accepting about how not everyone is as smart as they are.  They also have a limited tolerance for people who are a little socially inept compared to themselves, but only for a while at a time before they try to spend time with their friends and family.  When they are bored with someone they tend to hide any eye-ball rolling and keep it to themselves, but not always.</p>

<p align="left">Gold's face looks best to zarakites when a Gold's face has either pure white or Caucasian skin.  His face looks good with blond hair as well as the full variety of colors that dracos can have.</p>

<p align="left">When surprised, either by a prank or something else, Gold is capable of a double-take or even a triple-take that zarakites would call 'classic' in Zarakite English slang, with the mouth dropped-open in astonishment, just one trait of many for his face that zarakites find adorable.</p>

<p align="left">Golds are highly physically attractive and precious to other zarakite personalities, at least at fifth age, regardless of body size.</p>

<p align="left">When overwhelmed and when pranked, Gold faced tend to freak out a bit and get neurotic.  This doesn't cause any long term harm to them though, even if it happens often.  Gold faced are resilient in that they quickly bounce back from such things very quickly, and as soon as the stressful situation is over they are immediately back to normal, without any need for rest, and without being 'stressed out', at all.  When Gold faced freak out from losing, they do this to both the amusement and concern of others, and with zarakite personalities both happen depending on how far it goes.  Pranking Gold is fun and usually safe though, with how they always bounce back and have a high tolerance for such.  Their reactions to stress, if present, both come and go quickly.</p>

<p align="left">Gold faced really enjoy adventure and getting out of sticky situations.  They enjoy stealth and sneaking around, and surprise attacks, but don't mind a straight-up swordfight or gunfight.</p>

<p align="left">While Gold enjoys harmless jokes and pranks as well as more extreme ones, he learns easily which of his friends and family do and don't enjoy the same, and which ones are okay to rag on versus simply not liking such things.  Gold faced also tend to get bored with other people who don't ever prank them or give them any adventure or fun.  As such, Gold faced will therefore sometimes prank certain friends and family in return but not others, understanding which ones can take what kind of a joke and where everyone's threshold is, as well as differentiating between how some tolerate such things while only some actually enjoy it.</p>

<p align="left">Regarding pranks and practical jokes, two Gold faced who get to know each other really have fun with each other quickly and enjoy each other, and hone their skills at trickery, having fun the whole time.  They will spend a lot of time with each other.  Golds love that type of thing.  Their skills at pranking and practical jokes however only get so good, and for whatever unknown reason level off, still comparable for the most part to what they would be otherwise.  This might be because of the downside of how zarakite personalities don't ever get tired of anything fun for too long, and after doing something else fun their interest and pleasure bounces back for just as long, no matter how many times they do something they enjoy, even after thousands and millions of literal years and more.</p>

<p align="left">Gold faced are also very smart and perform well academically, and make good computer programmers.  They also have a decent sense of humor.  If they do get into computer programming they don't become computer dorks or socially inept.  They can become a little bit of a geek but not too much.</p>

<p align="left">Aside from their intellectual and somewhat technical side, they enjoy being physical and athletic, and like - skateboarding, snowboarding, rock concerts, swimming, performing music such as playing guitar -.  They also like industrial and metal music and much of the same music that TigerStone faced enjoy.</p>

<p align="left">Golds like video games, but if they have work to get done they want to work first and play later.  Also, when it comes time to work they really put their nose to the grindstone, so to speak, and work hard, and really keep it going.</p>

<p align="left">Gold faced dragons, like other zarakites, don't slow down when they get work going, and have more than enough energy for fun at other times.  Gold faced zarakites of course don't sleep, as no zarakite requires sleep or gets sleepy or worn out, not with their natures and their biology.  Gold faced humans however do sleep, and as such they sometimes live lives where they work hard and don't have much or any free time for recreation or fun.  Gold faced humans that have some zarakite dragon blood in them of course are less prone to this.</p>

<p align="left">Gold faced are extremely handsome and cute, and their attractive voices lack anything repulsive.</p>

<p align="left">On the battlefield, Gold is good at strategy and logic.  When there isn't time to stop and think, he uses reflexes and instincts.  When he has a few moments to decide how to approach an enemy or situation, he's fairly good at tactics, and can be trained to take advantage of this potential at an academy or school.</p>

<p align="left">Gold faced can be sneaky sometimes, as well as dishonest.  In many cases they use this for good, to fight evil, and to protect themselves and their property.  They have the capability doing so for evil, but often use it for good, as well as - jokes, pranks, tricks, etc -.  This is all characteristic of most zarakites, not just this particular face.</p>

<p align="left">When it comes to weapon gloves and fighting styles, Golds tend to be good at fighting with only one weapon at a time, better so than fighting with one weapon in each hand.</p>

<p align="left">Golds tend to like to dress up with flash and counter-culture styles of sorts ('counter culture' as in being into wearing punk outfits, having a mohawk haircut, long hair while being male in gender, wearing male earrings and ear cuffs etc, dreadlocks, etc, as examples, the opposite of formal and extremely traditional styles of dress and hair styles and lifestyles, and counter-culture by the way is to have fun and 'have a life' and is part of youth fun and for going out to have fun, and is not to be confused with deviant or law-breaking personalities or lifestyles which are only sometimes associated with counter-culture but many times not.  There are, by the way, counter-culture children who grow up with male earrings and mohawk haircuts and punk rocker jackets etc who also get good grades in school and get accepted to good universities after school and get good career jobs, who never get into trouble with the law, and never get into street drugs or too much smoking or drinking either.  Gold faced, and all zarakite personalities actually, tend be such 'clean cut' counter-culture personalities quite easily).</p>

<p align="left">Gold faced boys are very socially apt as well as easily having potential to get good grades in school.  They unfortunately tend to have standards that are too high for accepting others as friends.  This can easily leave them with few friends if any at times.  Sky dragons and tiger dragons with a Gold face don't suffer too much from this as they have the rest of the sky dragons and any tiger dragon of their family, that they are instinctively tight knit with for the life of the family, which also applies to the other sky dragons and tiger dragon of the family of zarakites.</p>

<p align="left">Tiger dragons that are Gold-faced get along good with their sky dragons and instinctively love them, and given how many sky dragons and tiger dragons of various families tend to socialize and befriend tiger dragons and sky dragons of each others' families, this prevents Gold faced tiger dragon zarakites from having too few friends.</p>

<p align="left">Golds don't like speech or text that is long-winded or unnecessary.  They tend to listen well to others that speak, and pay attention to entire sentences and all that others say, as opposed to other personalities that sometimes listen yet far more often listen to only a few words and ignore the rest of a sentence.  This wears out Gold's personality mentally if he has to listen to too much, especially if it gets absurd.  This can also easily irritate Gold, and make him reject any idea of being friends with someone who is too long-winded or 'wordy'.</p>

<p align="left">Tiger dragons and sky dragons who are Gold faced have an introverted side to themselves, and while they enjoy their family they are also zarakites that can get things done by themselves for a while before regrouping with their family and working together with their family as such.</p>
