Half Zarakite First And Middle Names
Half zarakite names are also often used for sky children, especially with those who are born in sky boy culture that
is predominantly Zarakite American culture. Half dragon names borrow and derive from a variety of historical species’
cultures, all continents of planet Earth from the start of the twenty-first century CE and preceding.
With this list of forenames, commonly referred to as ‘first names’, are notes and information regarding the
meanings and origins of such names. Note that just like the ancient species called humans who are from the same planet as
sky boys and zarakite tribes, there’s no actual link between the meanings of the names and how a half zarakite actually turns
out in any of their lives, and zarakites aren’t superstitious or anything. In fact some zarakites are prone to just naming all of
their half zarakites without really thinking too much about who gets what name but schoolteachers and grown up zarakites
hate that and don’t want any of their zarakites using the same first name twice in the same lesser family. Outside of their
lesser family but still within the same tribe, zarakites don’t always confer with each other about what names they give to
half zarakites with what faces. Some times they do and sometimes they don’t, and even when they do they sometimes take
half zarakites with the same face and give them the same first name [as long as they aren’t born ejaculated out of the same
zarakite’s penis, this is okay]. Doing something screwball such as having two boys with the same face in the same tribe
with the exact same first and middle name is really frowned upon and isn’t something any zarakite’s schoolteacher lets him
get away with, at least not for too long. [Yes, they check IDs, every wallet, and yes, they know what pranks and dumb
nonsense to look for. No, they don’t just check once. Yes, some zarakites, who are very young baby dragons after all, who
are anything but grown up, still pull a few silly stunts anyways from time to time. Yes, the schoolteachers are meticulous,
and yes, other sky boys DO tattle on dumb nonsense from newborn young zarakite dragons, as all half zarakites put up with
being named by such immature dragons and schoolteachers and the tribes are well aware of this and take it into account in
their culture and public schools etc. Yes, baby zarakite dragons DO prank and try to pull tricks on their elders as they can
certainly do more than speak and wisecrack literally just a few seconds after being born the very first time. Young baby
zarakites quickly learn that when it comes to humor and pranks they are encouraged to learn practical jokes that can turn
into sword-fighting and stinging and gun-fighting tactics for hunting and stealth and fighting, but when it comes to social
stuff and telling a story they are terrible at telling convincing lies and suck at getting away with such things and do much
better sticking to sarcasm and joking about what they saw one of their friends or family do the other day as well as ragging
on each other like many teenage boys do. Cynical humor works, and so does sarcasm and mocking, also ragging, both
penile and otherwise, just as quick examples, but telling a lie so that others actually believe it and are deceived and later find
something missing or used up because of such are very taboo and also evil in zarakite values and so Zare of SkyCrowne
forbids all sky boys to be able to develop such with anything beyond a very pathetic skill level via a divine and permanent
decision made long ago that cannot be challenged or undone.]
Note that a half zarakite’s last name is always the name of his tribe. The number of middle names a half dragon
can have vary, some half dragons only have one middle name, while others have more. Typically, the number of middle
names a half dragon has is consistent within a lesser family, and while such is the general tendency for a zarakite to do this
with his half zarakite children, there aren’t any hard or fast rules regarding such. Also, zarakites do sometimes change their
minds over the years regarding such things, and how they manage their half zarakites as such is just one example. Note that
‘English’ in the notes and origins is rather broad and can mean American Historical English as well as non-American
Historical English [British, Australian, Elizabethan, etc] as well as various Zarakite English origins. ‘Indian’ refers to East
India, and not ‘Native American’, of course.
Half zarakite names remind all sky boys of things that relate to all of the following concepts combined:
youthfulness, being young, having vigor and vitality, having energy and quick fast strength that is decisive that comes with
countless quick decisive strikes that are one after another without delay in between moves in sword-fighting, being athletic,
being strong in spirit, being male but not ‘manly’, teenage boy adolescence, being a warrior, being a quest-taker, being and
adventurer, and altruism. SkyCrowne and all combined Zarakite Values mesh well with these concepts. Common desires

and cravings of all sky boys and especially the primal ‘dragon’ of all instincts that all sky boys of all clans share also have
all of these qualities.
